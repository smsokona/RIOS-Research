Diversifying and Humanizing Scientist Role Models Through Interviews and Constructing Slide Decks on Researchers’ Research and Life Experiences,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.1,Lesson,2022,"proffessional development and career planning, science process skills","research, diversity, inclusion, Scientific Process, Representation, Scientist, Role Models",yes,"This lesson was designed to both introduce (or re-introduce) students to the importance of diversity in science, as well as to help students humanize researchers for themselves. We used active learning to make the teaching and classroom activities as inclusive as possible (see “Active Learning,” above).

This lesson challenged students to uncover their understandings about who can and does do research, while at the same time allowing them to learn more about a research area that particularly interested them. Students directly approached questions of bias and inclusion in STEM, both through discussions and by reflecting on social aspects of their own education related to their interests in science and research. In their interviews, students asked researchers about their personal journeys and struggles, which uncovered elements of humanity in faculty and instructors that students might not otherwise have learned about.

Student engagement was facilitated by instructors to ensure that students were able to contribute verbally (in discussions and think-pair-share activities), through writing (via quick writes), and in a variety of different roles (producing, giving feedback, revising) within their small groups. These activities were intended to ensure that all students were able to participate fully using their skills and strengths.

In accordance with the principles of inclusive teaching laid out by Kimberly Tanner (23), we employed a variety of low-stakes and collaborative teaching strategies to facilitate the group work. We were particularly careful to make sure that student-conceived norms for the classroom were applied and revisited throughout the course (22–24). This was especially important during discussions of inclusion, equity, and diversity, which introduced challenging descriptions of gender and racial bias that some students had not encountered in a classroom before.

Because student choice and interest drive motivation and ownership (22, 25–27), students had a wide range of topics to explore (anything that fell under the flexible rubric of “natural science”, including both physical and life sciences). Based on their scientific and research interests, students formed groups, which were different from previous groups that they had worked with. Thus, within the classroom, the diversity of student interests and strengths became immediately clear to all participants. 

This lesson explicitly addresses the roles that identity plays in scientists’ lives and work. We used principles of inclusive teaching to ensure participation by all students at the same time that we explored how and why participation in science is still not universal (See “diversity in science” below). By providing students with choice, they also gained agency and self-efficacy in their own education and exploration.

Group work is inherent to this lesson plan. We acknowledge that group work can be prohibitively difficult for students with extracurricular pressures and responsibilities such as work, commutes, and family. Therefore, we recommend using smaller groups (3-4 students) rather than larger groups so that students within groups are better able to find times to meet outside of class. We also recommend forming groups with heterogeneity in mind; groups should have students with different levels of previous experience and competency levels in regard to the subject matter (28). For students from underrepresented backgrounds and identities, we recommend that whenever possible, groups do not have only one representative from that underrepresented background to prevent feelings of isolation (29).

Meiosis Remodeled: Inclusion of New Parts to Poppit Bead Models Enhances Understanding of Meiosis,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.2,Lesson,2022,"cell biology, genetics, introduction biology","meiosis, chiasma formation, chromosome recombination",Yes,"PoppitMeiosis is designed to be adaptable for a wide range of curricula, and under the widest of circumstances – in a lecture course or seminar, in a classroom, in a laboratory setting, and for ‘self-teaching’ in a home situation. The lesson employs instructional materials that are easily and widely available, and with which students can work at their own pace and depth, depending on their individual backgrounds, needs, learning abilities and styles. PoppitMeiosis encourages learning and understanding of chromosomes in meiosis, the teaching of which has been a challenge for generations of educators. Poppit’s hands-on approach is inviting to students of virtually all learning styles and abilities. It offers ways they can quickly engage with the material at hand and therefore be encouraged to talk, listen, and interact on the task. PoppitMeiosis thus naturally creates an atmosphere that improves understanding of meiosis and thereby enhances appreciation of the significance of meiosis, as it relates to all sexually reproducing organisms: plants, animals and humans.

Case studies can be adapted to a variety of courses and formats. We have implemented this case as a series of handouts formatted for ADA accessibility to be screen-reader friendly. We provide the worksheets both as physical handouts and as editable electronic documents. We have used Google Docs to encourage groups of students to work collaboratively, both in class and virtually (often asynchronously). In-class discussions are used to facilitate contributions by all participants. Several of the questions have multiple potential responses and can be used to foster productive discussions about the methodology and future experiments, prompting students to think critically about high-throughput technologies, for example. See Supporting File S3. Does Organelle Shape Matter? - Teaching Notes.

Additionally, in-class administration of the case can be accomplished using several student-centered active learning techniques including group work, think-pair-share, and whip around to promote learning (15). Case studies can be used as low-stakes assignments to foster productive discussions, use of high-throughput databases and resources, and quantitative skills. Instructors are encouraged to allow students to submit completed cases in alternative formats including audio and video files.

While many students find summer research opportunities more demanding, highly competitive, and less accessible due to students’ obligations outside of school, course-embedded research opportunities allow all students to engage in science (16). Students with different attitudes toward science, different preferences for lab work and computational data analysis, and different levels of prior knowledge work together in small teams. This laboratory series involves investigating plant genetics, a topic frequently omitted from genetics courses, thus attempting to address “plant awareness disparity,” lack of plant-related topics in many college biology courses. Students discuss, observe, and investigate genetic diversity of maize lines and make connections to genetic diversity in human populations.

On the first day of the course we discuss why we use this strategy, explicitly referencing the Eddy, Brownell and Wenderoth (8) finding that males volunteer answers more often than females.
In order to make random call less threatening, we use a highly structured process following many of the principles outlined by Waugh and Andrews (9). Students work on the question once on their own, then with a group so they have had time to think and discuss the question. We use inclusive language by asking about the process, not for the answer: “Student X, what was your group discussing?” or “What were your group’s thoughts?” We frame random call on the first day of the course as being the start of a discussion, not an assessment of a particular student. Students with extreme anxiety are able to opt-out of the random call list and we do not assign any credit for answering or not answering the call. 
In order to accurately refer to students we have a pre-course survey in which we obtain each student’s preferred name and pronoun.
To support issues of identity and belonging in the classroom, we frequently use short, unscripted statements to reinforce all students’ rightful presence in the course and each students’ intrinsic value. We openly acknowledge that students frequently feel “imposter” syndrome and encourage them to seek study groups or help from staff.
On the first day of class, we have shared our own academic stories of “feeling like a failure” to normalize the fact that we all struggle and can still succeed.
We use positive language to frame student responses and encourage continued discussion.
Our institution has a service contract with Poll Everywhere so all students have free access to polling software. If an institution does not have this access, an equitable option could be to simply ask students to raise their hands or hand out index cards with letters or that are different colors so that students can raise the card that indicates their selection. One drawback to this method is that it can stigmatize students who have the incorrect selection, so students may lose a sense of belonging.",366,,,,2018?,15
A classroom intervantion to reduce confirmation bias,Https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.7,Lesson,2022,science process skills,"bias, process of science, metacognition, confirmation bias, cognitive bias",yes,"This activity is open to all students, independent of academic background, identity, or major. Our class was a blend of hearing and deaf/hard-of-hearing (D/HH) students, and the discussions and activities were designed to encourage participation by all. D/HH students are supported in the classroom by campus-based access services, which may include sign language interpreters or real-time captionists, depending on the student’s needs and preferences. Because our course was targeted to first generation and D/HH students (21), early in the course the students were all given instructions and modeled behavior of how to support an inclusive learning environment for individuals with disabilities.

The puzzle activity includes two roles – a guesser and a teller, and students are allowed to select the role in which they are most comfortable. The use of this intervention supports the development of metacognitive skills, particularly monitoring one's own learning. Aspects of identity, including being aware of ways in which reasoning and identity intersect, can be included in classroom discussions. The controversial topics themselves often lead to discussions in the classroom around diversity, and cultural or political diversity in particular. For example, one of the topics discussed in our classroom is hydrofracking, and the discussion about the pros and cons of this method for extracting energy often shifts to political and rural/urban differences in how this topic is viewed and how information about its utility and safety is presented. Modeling respectful behavior and active listening (28) is incorporated throughout the course.

The instructor can ask the students whether the same situation holds for their own classes based on their observations. The implications of the paper sparked debate about sexism in political science and in STEM, and so it is important to prepare for this by stressing that as instructors, we strive to create inclusive environments in which everyone is comfortable contributing. No matter a student’s subjective opinion about the implications of the paper, everyone can participate and answer the research questions posed by the paper with the data provided. Also, inherent to this work is the question whether gender is a binary variable. However, the ethics of this nature of research can also be something addressed in class. If the instructor is not feeling prepared to discuss such a highly politicized issue, they can note that in this case, the researcher uses “gender” to mean “sex.” In fact, in most government or healthcare facilities collected data up until now the variable “gender” only assumes two values: male and female, meaning that they actually mean “sex.”

We embedded the argumentation module within the context of a big question with real-life relevance to increase student motivation and participation. There is no single right answer that emerges from the data which invites groups to privilege sharing of different ideas. We also used multiple and varied modes of low-stakes assessments which allows learners to display diverse ideas and ways of knowing. By inviting small groups to share out to the whole class, the instructor is creating opportunities for students’ cultural funds of knowledge to gain visibility. This is particularly important for underrepresented students as without such opportunities there could be culturally driven interpretations of the biology information that may be invisible to the instructor.

Therefore, inexpensive and easily available kitchen ingredients and tools are used, and there is no need for any electronic instrument other than a smartphone or digital camera. Instructors are encouraged to consider using flours from the culinary traditions of diverse cultures; sequences of glutenin proteins (or analogues) from a variety of domesticated grains can be found in UniProt. Additionally, the connection of protein structure to cooking and food crops makes the laboratory engaging and relatable to a wide range of students, particularly those in applied disciplines related to biology, including nutrition, food science, and agricultural sciences. The emphasis on tactile, as opposed to visual/auditory sensory input, makes this laboratory particularly helpful for students with visual or hearing impairments; these students may further benefit from subtitling or narration of the instructional videos as deemed appropriate by the instructor.

A Laboratory Module That Explores RNA Interference and Codon Optimization Through Fluorescence Microscopy Using Caenorhabditis elegans,Https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.15,Lesson,2022,"Bioinformatics, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, Genetics, Science Process Skills","microscopy, C. elegans, quantitative analysis, inquiry-based learning, gene expression, RNA interference, Codon Usage, Laboratory Module",Yes,"We have designed this module to be all-inclusive by differentiating content and lesson material to reach all types of learners. The hands-on activities of this module capture the attention and engagement of kinesthetic and tactile learners. Our short lectures that contain images, provide written instruction, and facilitate discussion amongst the class are accommodating to both visual and auditory learners. Given that Stony Brook University consists of a highly diverse population of students, during group activities, we can easily divide our class into diversified groups at random using a freely available random name picking software called Wheel Decide. We highly recommend that instructors utilize this tool given that it avoids any self-selection or instructor selection biases.

To ensure that students feel welcomed, we establish classroom “etiquette”, similar to that suggested by Tanner 2013, where we emphasize that all students are expected to support one another and share their ideas in a judgement free manner (36). On the first day of class, we implemented an ice-breaker activity, called “catch the ball”, where all students and faculty “threw” around an imaginary ball to one another, and those who “caught” the ball on a turn introduced themselves, shared their interests, hobbies, and goals. We suggest a similar activity be implemented during the start of the course so that instructors can familiarize themselves with their students. To further create an inclusive learning environment, we ensure that all students have the means to be successful in the module. We ensure class material for the lesson is posted on Blackboard and/or in Google Drive in a timely fashion so that students can access it prior to the start of class and afterwards. For students who may not have equal access to technology, we provide hard copies, as well as digital copies, of assignments and lab protocols. We also hold office hours on request and have discussion boards available so everybody can benefit from each other's questions and/or discussions. Moreover, based on information obtained from class assessments (see above) and observations, students who have difficulties with any of the class content receive extra support and guidance as needed. Thus, the module ensures equity and inclusivity by reaching all types of learners and ensuring students receive the support they need to succeed in the module.

Mock Drug Activity Enhances Student Learning About the Challenges of HIV/AIDS Therapy,Https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.16,Lesson,2022,Microbiology,"drug resistance, Retrovirus, Viral replication",Yes,"In small groups, students answer questions about the drug activity to compare their experience with other students in the group. Student experiences could be different based on several factors, including drug therapy protocol assigned, previous experience taking regular medication, and class/work schedules. The small group discussion allows students to appreciate how their experience was different from other students in the group even if they were assigned to the same drug protocol. In the class wide discussion students can compare their group responses to the rest of the class. Most recently, I have used the response software Poll Everywhere (polleverywhere.com) to survey the class on these questions. Response software allows students to contribute to the discussion that may otherwise not feel comfortable speaking to the whole class. Students also often discuss this activity with family and friends and can observe public attitudes about HIV/AIDS through these interactions. In the United States HIV/AIDS disproportionally affects members of the LGBTQ, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino communities (9). Therefore, this activity reveals the impact of science in diverse communities.

The use of small group discussion following large group report-outs gives both extroverts and introverts time to formulate a response before providing a well-reasoned response. The content of the Lesson is also broadly applicable to all students, especially in the context of a laboratory course, in which all students will produce research reports that should contain citations. For example, one study suggests that students may be more prone to plagiarism when writing in a language that is not their native language (16), and providing instruction in plagiarism might help address that issue (6).",130,,,,,
s Earth Currently Undergoing a Sixth Mass Extinction?,Https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.19,Lesson,2022,"Ecology, Evolution, Introductory Biology","conservation, Biodiversity, extinction, Mass Extinction, Deep Time",Yes,"This lesson focuses on several inclusive teaching practices related to community building. Students are asked to work collaboratively in small groups and to discuss poll questions. Poll questions are graded based on participation rather than selection of the correct answer. This grading policy encourages students to seek help when they are incorrect, rather than be concerned about their grade (12). Throughout the lesson, students are encouraged to share their opinions and unique perspectives on how to combat various societal challenges, including conservation and climate change, while respecting peers who may hold perspectives and opinions different from their own. When we taught this lesson, students disagreed regarding whether current biodiversity losses amount to a mass extinction event. Students also held differing views about the role of government in conservation. Despite these differences, discussion remained respectful, and students were receptive to alternative viewpoints. We encourage instructors to remind students to be respectful throughout the semester and to consider creating community guidelines for appropriate discussion behaviors.

Student socioeconomic diversity was also considered throughout the design of this lesson. To prevent economic barriers, students are not required to purchase any textbooks or other supplementary materials to participate in this lesson. Additionally, all assessment questions can be answered based on information provided on lecture slides and do not require outside resources. We also expose students to the work of under-acknowledged scientists. For example, we present the efforts of Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, who was one of few woman museum curators in the early 1900s, toward preserving a coelacanth specimen (Supporting File S4. 6th Mass Extinction–Class Session I Slides, Slide 16) with the goal of highlighting scientific contributions made by individuals of varied backgrounds (13).

Finally, students are provided with multiple means to achieve the desired learning objectives including discussion, writing, images and diagrams, and poll questions. Similarly, students are offered multiple formats of assessment questions including written and multiple choice to provide an opportunity for each student to display their knowledge of key concepts.",325,,,,,

A Modeling Exercise in Sexual Selection using a Student-Created Bird Species",Https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.20,Lesson,2022,"Ecology, Evolution, Introductory Biology","Evolution, fitness, sexual selection, Natural Selection, intersexual selection, mate choice",yes,"In this lesson, we use the terms “flashy” birds to indicate bird sexes characterized by more coloration, distinct patterns, and complicated song and mating rituals, and “less flashy birds” to indicate bird sexes that have more subdued coloration, less vibrant patterns, and simpler (or no) song and mating rituals. While male birds are often flashier than females, we wanted to emphasize to students that not all bird species follow this trend (e.g., species in which the females tend to have more influence or choice during the mating process) and to avoid supporting misconceptions related to heteronormative behaviors during sexual selection (4-8).

This activity has the potential to engage many students, as students tend to be interested in organisms they encounter or observe in their daily lives (e.g., birds).

This lesson encompasses a variety of learning modalities in which students are required to use multiple senses to accomplish tasks, such as creating flashy birds out of modeling dough as well as oral and visual sharing of models at the end of the class period.

This activity requires students to collaborate in both small groups and as a whole class, so there is also the potential that students will form novel connections with their peers during the lesson.

Thus, students are using multiple senses (e.g., oral, visual, mechanical) to complete each escape room activity.

Students have multiple opportunities to express agency and creativity during this lesson; one particularly strong example of this—which also allows students to explore evolutionary biologists with diverse identities—is the activity which asks students to explore the Project Biodiversify website and summarize three novel things they learned about their chosen biologist.

This activity requires students to work in small groups (e.g., in Zoom breakout rooms), interact with the instructors (e.g., to receive approval before progressing to the next activity), and share ideas with the entire class, so there is potential to foster a sense of community and collaboration throughout the two-day lesson.

Integrating Community Ecology Into the Study of Parasites: Exploring the Effect of Host Behavior on Parasite Transmission Rates,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.22,Lesson,2022,"Ecology, Science Process Skills","statistics, species interactions, Quantitative reasoning, graphs, Community Ecology, Parasitology, food webs",yes,"Many of the case studies used to illustrate the principles of parasitology involve human health and well-being and provide a wealth of opportunities to model respectful and inclusive ways of discussing the diverse lives and experiences of humans around the world. For example, lecture material in the ecology and evolution unit of this course included discussions of human diseases (e.g., hookworm, malaria) and ecological issues (e.g., amphibian loss to chytrid fungus) that disproportionately affect people living in tropical regions and the Global South (19). In discussing these topics, we were careful to counteract harmful and pervasive stereotypes that associate parasite risk with the behaviors and cultural markers of certain groups of people, and not to invoke colonialist assumptions about the economic development and public health infrastructure of regions affected by these ecological problems and diseases (20). Wherever possible, we also focused on research of scientists living in the regions most affected by the subject of their study.

Due to the inherent intertwining of human experiences with health- and environment-related topics in parasitology, there are ample opportunities in this kind of course for engaging students with activities that will allow them to reflect critically on the intersections of social equity, public health, and their own assumptions through a socio-scientific issues framework (21, 22). For example, the link between hookworm infection, anemia, and impaired cognitive development is often illustrated in parasitology textbooks through the story of Charles Stiles’ 1902 announcement of the discovery of the “germ of laziness” in the American Southeast and subsequent public health initiatives funded by John D. Rockefeller (e.g., 2, page 360). While this narrative conveys real historical events and biology, the commonly used structure of the story tacitly reinforces harmful stereotypes about the populations that were affected. It also ignores important historical context where public messaging around this biological discovery was used to support and spread racist and classist ideologies in public health and popular culture (23). Teaching such material can be made more inclusive by integrating an explicit discussion of the social context in which the scientific discoveries were made, and the role scientific information and subsequent interpretation play in constructing both public policy and public narratives (see 21, 22).

Furthermore, all assignment instructions are designed using principles of transparency shown to improve sense of belonging and success for students from marginalized backgrounds (25). In keeping with transparency practices, detailed rubrics and guidelines are provided for all assessments to ensure that students are aware of what is expected of them.

Additionally, the instructors serve as guides and research mentors rather than coming from a place as the absolute holders of knowledge and authority in the classroom. For example, students are empowered with the agency to make their own decisions about experiments, such as choosing which mutant strains to work with. Because analyses of primary journal articles and student-generated data take place through small-group discussion, peer instruction is emphasized over instructor-led lectures.

By its nature, this course makes a mentored research experience accessible to all enrolled students and enables participation in scientific inquiry, which together can help students develop a sense of belonging in science (13). All materials and resources for this course were provided by Duquesne University, granting equal access to learning and experimental procedures regardless of the background or need of our students. Adaptations to this protocol may be made to accommodate students with disabilities or students at an increased risk of infection from microorganisms. This course is taught under the context of microevolution and does not infringe on religious beliefs related to macroevolution. Finally, by discussing how diversity provides source material upon which natural selection can act, the course content fosters appreciation for the value of existing diversity in a population for the overall fitness of that species.

Case Studies create this type of environment by allowing time for individual learning and structured small-group discussion. In both cases, students are aware that there is not a single correct answer. During the individual learning stages, students are presented with information through both text and visualizations, and can take notes by writing, drawing, or preparing an oral summary. Students are also given the option to share their learning in a way that they are most comfortable with, as long as it is within the time-limit. Many students used both a prepared oral summary with their drawings to communicate with other students. This promotes individual ownerships of the learning materials and comfort in sharing ideas before groupwork.

Student groups for the discussion were formed randomly and then ‘shuffled’, allowing communication among students who may not interact on a day-to-day basis. This has the effect of increasing within-group cognitive, cultural, gender and personal identity (or hidden identities) diversity. Increasing diversity in groupwork can improve group-level problem-solving and individual learning (75–77). Within each group, students were given specific times to share their knowledge and take notes on others’ contributions. Ensuring that time was equally distributed among group members provides an opportunity for different ideas to emerge and for ensuring contributions from all students. Inclusive group work has been shown to have positive effects on individual- and group-level learning (78, 79). This type of active learning is student-centered, a strategy believed to improve student learning as well as student attitudes and experiences regarding biology (74).",280,,,,,

Because food is such an integral part of everyday life, this introduction provides an interesting start point for all students to explore the lesson and learn about risk assessment. Additionally, students have an opportunity to select pesticides and foods of their interest to investigate in Part 4. This will allow students of different backgrounds to participate in the lesson based on their preference for food and pesticide. This lesson requires a computer, Microsoft Excel, and an Internet connection, which are readily available even in institutions with limited resources. Due to the recent transition to online learning, schools normally provide free computers and WiFi hotspots as well as computer labs on campus, which allow students to complete online coursework. If free Microsoft Excel is not available, students can use Google Doc and Google Sheet (free with a Gmail account) to view the lesson and the dataset and complete data analysis. We also recommend think-pair-share or group work while going through the questions to encourage participation of students who may struggle with the questions.

It actively encourages group learning, but also provides a path for independent students to work on their projects on their own if they wish. Furthermore, because the students are designing their own questions, choosing their own testing locations, and making their own media, the class is inclusive for all students across different disciplines (e.g., a public health professional can swab different surfaces of the classroom, while an athletic nutrition major may test agar medias with various concentrations of sugar). This allows students to apply what they are learning about biology and the scientific method in a way that applies to their future careers and goals, making the lecture material much more likely to stick with them. A group-oriented option included in the handout designed for the pooling data does however introduce the potential for student exclusion. See the “Common Issues” section of the “Teaching Discussion” for tips on how to modify the lab to reduce this phenomenon.

While students collect measurements as individuals, the data are compiled into a class dataset. Students analyze this class data and thus need the contributions of their peers and class collaboration. Peer review also provided students with the chance to get feedback from someone with a different point of view, and who may have had different courses and scientific training. For example, some students were currently working in research labs, some had not performed any lab work since introductory biology (which may have been online), some had spent their entire undergraduate time at our university, and others were transfers from different institutions. Students also use multiple methods to collect data. They observe the plants visually, collect quantitative data with a ruler, and perform pollinations. They also gain experience in non-quantitative data, as they are asked to group M1 plants by their overall impression of how well the plants are growing.

Since this is an activity for small groups, the instructor has several choices on how to sort students in the class. Students could be allowed to individually select groups, or the instructor could pre-assign groups to encourage students to interact with individuals with whom they normally do not work, enabling students to learn the value of diverse perspectives and opinions. As instructors, we ensure that every group member is engaged in the entire discussion, and we discourage student isolation. We recommend that the instructor have each group determine roles such as facilitator, recorder, presenter, and timekeeper. This will encourage individual accountability. The positions can rotate as students transition from one question to the next. In doing this, it ensures that each student takes a different role at some point during the process and encourages participation of students who may struggle with the questions.

Students work in the same small groups throughout the term and physically sit in their group’s section of the room on group-work focused days. This design element allows students to develop camaraderie and familiarity with the same small group of students and their LA. In developing these structured seating arrangements, instructors should accommodate students who may need to sit in accessible areas of the classroom due to physical disabilities. We work in concert with LAs to ensure that all of the students in their groups are able to participate. Students may arrange with the instructor to opt out of group work and complete a modified DD activity on their own.

Group work is facilitated by LAs, a graduate TA, and a faculty instructor, allowing for a ~1:20 ratio of instructors (LA, TA, and Professor) to students. LAs are trained in promoting equitable group interactions, and the instructor maintains an identity-safe classroom environment through explicit articulated expectations and conversations. DD is predicated on a “consensus” model, and while there are no right or wrong answers, the activity concludes with students deliberating to form an agreed-upon policy recommendation related to the topic. Group roles are used to ensure each group member has a role in the activity, and each student additionally assigns themselves a specific piece of evidence that informs their group’s consensus, allowing students to engage with the topic in accordance with their own individual interests. Instructors remind students to recognize that there may be sensitive social and/or politicized aspects to their deliberations and proposed solutions and to civilly consider such factors. We encourage students to respectfully voice their own opinions and experiences in these deliberations and to encourage equitable participation among their peers. LAs are asked to alert the instructor and TA if any complications or inappropriate behavior arises.

However, if enough sequences are obtained, this lesson could be a prelude to a further lesson, where students compare what they learned about the species identified. Instructors implementing this activity can incorporate group learning by having students work in small groups of three to four individuals, where this activity can be part of either a laboratory or in-class activity. Groups need access to a device that will allow them to access the BLAST website at NCBI and explore the identified species for natural history traits. The group activity allows students to receive assistance from both the instructor and student peers. Moreover, this computational modeling group activity can appeal to non-traditional learners as it focuses on improving science processing skills, helping students make connections between molecular biology (nucleotide sequences) and organismal biology (species identified). Alternatively, if this activity is provided to students online or as a typical take-home class assignment, students with disabilities can extend the time needed for practice, as this activity can be self-paced. We recommend educators initially demonstrate how to upload sequences subjected to a BLAST, as it may help to guide students that may struggle with technology. This activity is highly customizable to educators. Students can view materials using multiple forms of presentation (with image, without image, using and interpreting simulation results, etc.), thus ultimately increasing the inclusivity of this activity.

The asynchronous portion of this lesson is self-paced, and in several parts, allowing flexibility in when and after how much time students complete the assignment. The guided notes that students fill out as they work through the module provides options to help students with comprehension by helping to maximize transfer and generalization (UDL 3.4). This lesson provides multiple means of engagement by allowing individual choice (UDL 7.1) of topics that students post about, and posts that they respond to. This approach allows the instructor to craft the synchronous portion of the lesson to cover topics on which students need the most help. In addition, the comic helps to make the complex topic of photosynthesis less intimidating to students, thus increasing interest.

Analysis of Microbiomes Using Free Web-Based Tools in Online and In-Person Undergraduate Science Courses,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.35,Lesson,2022,"Bioinformatics, Ecology, Microbiology","microbiome, DNA Subway, CyVerse, Course based undergraduate research, QIIME2, ranacapa",Yes,"The written and video tutorials presented here are designed to provide students with visual materials they can reference at their own pace. Most of the assignments are low stakes to help minimize student stress and to facilitate student learning. By using free, web-based bioinformatics tools that have a GUI format, we aim to increase the accessibility and comfort level of students towards conceptual understanding of the material. Students are also allowed ample time outside of class to complete assignments. Students may perform the analyses alone if they choose, or in groups of 2-4 students to encourage discussion and peer mentoring. Additionally, as this entire lesson plan may be performed online, these activities facilitate remote learning.

The web-based tools presented here are well suited for remote inclusive teaching because they do not require high-end or expensive computer systems, nor do they require high-speed internet. Although microbiome datasets can be quite large, students do not need to upload or download any large datasets or files, as all file transfers are done virtually via the CyVerse infrastructure connected to DNA Subway. Similarly, all computational processes performed by DNA Subway are run virtually via the CyVerse infrastructure, decreasing the dependence on reliable internet connectivity (once a job is started it runs regardless of whether one is connected to the internet or logged onto DNA Subway). It also eliminates the need for large memory or processing requirements of personal computers. In fact, the analysis performed by DNA Subway can be successfully completed using a smartphone with a web browser, which would allow students without a computer or internet access to complete this activity.

We also acknowledge the barriers that remain for many students and institutions relating to lack of adequate technology or internet connectivity, and that each college or university tackles such challenges differently. We also acknowledge that there is no single answer that will accommodate all students and institutions. For educators who may be interested in incorporating this activity with their students, but who are concerned about the lack of access to technology for their students, one possible alternative may be for the instructor to perform the DNA Subway and ranacapa analyses that their students recommend (based on initial discussion and hypothesis generation step) and print the resulting graphs and figures of each step performed along the way to show students the process. These hardcopies may then be disseminated to students, where they can follow the written tutorial and learn to interpret each of the graphs. In this way, students may still be engaged with the data analysis and graph interpretation process, even if they did not go through the steps on a computer themselves. In this case, the learning outcomes would emphasize graph interpretation and communication of results as opposed to the technical aspects of using the web tools.

First, by utilizing active learning techniques, known to narrow achievement gaps for underrepresented students in STEM disciplines (27), this lesson aims to support the success of all students. Second, the lesson was taught in a classroom at a large public Midwestern research university to students who may not have met many people from other countries. By selecting a paper written by Japanese scientists, students can see the contribution that scientists from around the globe make to science. Third, research from Cooper et al. revealed that some active learning strategies may increase anxiety to an unproductive level for some students, but that there are ways to mitigate this risk (28). Based on suggestions from Cooper et al. (28) and the instructor’s conversations with students who have expressed these same concerns, this lesson structure takes measures to alleviate some of this stress. For example, students know ahead of time to expect peer discussion. The instructor also allows students to self-select their partners or groups, and groups volunteer to report out their discussion results rather than utilizing cold or random call. Fourth, the instructor made efforts to ensure that all students wanting to participate were included in a group. During the “pair” portion of think-pair-share, the instructor circulated the room and asked solo students if they would like to join a group. If they said yes, the instructor facilitated introductions to a group nearby. Finally, introducing research literature to an undergraduate course not only improves students’ ability to read and interpret research articles, it can change their perceptions of science identity and self-efficacy, and benefits a diverse set of students (8, 29, 30), suggesting that the introduction of research literature will aid in efforts to diversify the field of immunology.

Studies demonstrate marginalized students, such as students of color, low-income students, first-generation students, student veterans, and students with disabilities, benefit the most from undergraduate research experiences and experience compensatory gains in academic success when compared to their White peers (1, 22, 4). Furthermore, there is research to suggest that the completion of a research experience early in their academic career is the single most impactful method for increasing the retention and academic success of historically marginalized students in STEM (5, 23). 

This project maximizes the participation of historically marginalized student populations in research because it was developed and taught at community colleges, which serve the majority of these student populations, and brings in these equitable teaching techniques into the first and second year courses. Our approach of doing research in existing courses democratizes research and increases access. This series of lessons are designed to replace the required laboratory section of a major’s biology course; it is integrated into the student pathway and accesses far more students than a special topics course or independent study model. CUREs work for diversifying science and research because they are built into the core student experience and don’t require students to do anything “extra,” and therefore minimize barriers for historically marginalized populations (2). Furthermore, our pedagogy of fostering high expectations, forming a community of practice, and de-risking failure supports an inclusive learning environment.",247,,,,,

CUREs thereby remove a barrier to access that is difficult for some students, particularly those from underserved groups, to overcome. Like all CUREs, the SEAS CURE thus provides an excellent opportunity to include all students in authentic research experiences, at levels ranging from introductory to advanced (14).

The fate of corals in a warming world is a topic about which few students know much from their own experience or their prior academic work. However, once they begin learning about the ecosystem services of corals and the human dimensions of coral reef decline, almost all students find the issue compelling and urgent. Students quickly grasp that the complexity of this work demands skills and perspectives from a broad range of disciplines. They also recognize that the diversity required to solve large global challenges encompasses not only scientific disciplines but also identities such as gender, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, personality, and approach to problem-solving (15). In each of the AREs described here, students engage in making connections across ecological, organismal, physiological and cellular scales to address impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic threats to the ecosystem services of corals.

To create and empower inclusive research teams, instructors must be intentional about demonstrating the value of diversity in teamwork and must make the practice of collaborative work (including effective communication, conflict management, and consensus building) a key learning objective for the course (16). A core competency in the Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education report is the “ability to communicate and collaborate with other disciplines.” Both faculty and students should be intentional and reflective about engaging in teamwork, first by making the collaborative process a valued component of each student’s individual efforts and second by implementing teaching approaches that support students in developing inclusive and equitable collaboration skills. An excellent resource for instructors wishing to cultivate inclusivity and equity in teamwork is available at the Eberly Center at Carnegie Mellon University. This resource offers suggestions for teaching approaches that support students as they form a team and work together through a project (e.g., how to structure teamwork in a way that ensures interdependence among the students, how to create accountability of each individual while working in a team). Valuing the collaborative process is key to cultivating inclusivity and equity because doing so allows students to see for themselves that complex problems require diverse skills, perspectives, and contributions.

When implementing CUREs, work should be scaffolded so that students can establish an initial base of knowledge and skills and then build upon that foundation as they engage in the research process. For this reason, we encourage instructors to start with the PLA that introduces students to the SEA System. While familiarizing students with background information about the SEA System, instructors can use the simple laboratory activities embedded within the PLA to help students develop and practice the skills they will need when they begin developing their own project ideas (e.g., culturing the symbiotic partners). Further, by beginning with a broad introduction to the SEA System, instructors scaffold subsequent work, allowing students to tackle problems that would otherwise be intractable. Scaffolding is vital to an inclusive classroom as it provides instructors with a method for adapting their teaching to the individual needs of students (17).

This reassures many students when their data is not what they may have expected. In our experience, almost every student is able to get some reasonable data in this series of experiments due to the robust nature and abundance of the enzyme being studied. While the enzyme activity data is quantitative and must be graphed and carefully analyzed, the gel and observations throughout the two-week series are visual and therefore more qualitative, demonstrating that both qualitative and quantitative analyses are important in this discipline. Quantitative analysis and graphing might be challenging to some students with less preparation in this area. In some cases, the quantitative analysis could be reduced or simplified; for example, the purification table could be eliminated (this is considered further in the Teaching Discussion). However, we attempt to bring every student along through extensive peer teaching with the use of undergraduate teaching assistants in addition to the availability of the course instructor. The diversity of data collection and analysis provided by this laboratory exercise illustrates the advice given by E. O. Wilson to the young scientist: “For every scientist, whether researcher, technologist, or teacher, of whatever competence in mathematics, there exists a discipline in science for which that level of mathematical competence is enough to achieve excellence.” (23) p. 41.

The academic level is most often junior/senior undergraduate level or first/second year graduate level students that are also diverse in other respects, including but not limited to gender, race, and nationality. Many use English as a second (possibly third) language. To ensure that all students are engaged and participate in learning, this STEM learning activity has an intrinsic cultural component, the Three Sisters concept, developed by indigenous populations. The book Braiding Sweetgrass by R.W. Kimmerer, a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, includes this and other indigenous lectures on plants for foods and medicine (13). The inclusion of an indigenous concept into a STEM science course communicates to students from underrepresented groups that different cultures are valued. This is especially important since evidence is growing that the achievement gap between underrepresented students and white students is due to a sense of belonging (or lack thereof) and not an understanding of the learning material (14).

Along with this deliberate ‘pedagogical’ choice to include diverse cultures into a STEM science classroom, another strategy promoted by Dewsbury and Brame for inclusive teaching is ‘empathy’ (15). I have always found it helpful to connect to students early in the course by showing up before class and engaging them in discussion on course and other topics.

Jill does not have formal scientific or medical training, and not only does she successfully determine the genetic cause of her own disease, but she also correctly hypothesizes that an Olympic athlete, Priscilla Lopes-Schliep, has a mutation in the same gene (6). Jill’s journey includes interactions with doctors and researchers, and demonstrates that anybody can be a scientist if they question and pursue information. In addition, diverse students learn well from illustrative case studies (8) and we find that students from all backgrounds are acutely interested in human diseases. To expand the ethical discussion beyond muscular dystrophy, we included optional debate questions that challenge students to think about the definition of a disability and how disabilities can build communities. Engaging students in large group discussion and small group work is extremely beneficial; it increases student achievement and persistence, develops communication and teamwork skills, and generates more favorable attitudes toward science (reviewed in 10). Students perceive that group work facilitates learning and strengthens the link between empirical and theoretical learning (11). Groups of students that are ethnically diverse, mixed gender, and include students with different approaches to problem solving collaborate better than more homogenous groups (reviewed in 10).

Since there are multiple opportunities for groups to participate in the class discussion, the instructor can devise a way to hear from all/most groups (for example, assign specific groups to respond to each question in the exercises). Students work in small groups of 2-3. The instructor may also form the work groups to increase the mixing of students outside their typical social circles.

This lesson seeks to create a learning environment where students' academic, social, and cultural backgrounds can be an asset to their learning. Because there can be a variety of responses in each matrix box, all student viewpoints and conclusions can be included in class discussions.

The majority of class discussions occurred in small groups, often with the same students, resulting in students becoming comfortable enough to share their answers freely. Additionally, because there was more than one ""correct"" answer for each matrix table, it became easier for students to share their answers without the fear of being wrong. However, for the larger group discussions, we asked for volunteers and did not force students to address the class if they did not volunteer.

Thus, the lesson includes several strategies, including think-pair-share, small group discussions, and a strip sequence, which allows for students who favor different learning approaches to engage with the concepts and topics. At the beginning of class, instructors can explicitly state to the class that the intention of the varied learning strategies is to promote an equitable and accessible classroom for all students (15). This promotes inclusive learning as students feel less targeted during random call or when students are asked to contribute during class discussion. I have found that a high level of transparency in my teaching approaches is well received by students and it encourages students who are more accustomed to traditional lecture classes open up to active learning styles. Though there is a short lecture within this lesson, it is designed to be concise and engaging as intellectual engagement is minimally elicited during traditional in-class lectures (16).

Students work together in small groups multiple times during this lesson as it cultivates social learning and peer education. As small groups have been shown to support learning gains (17) and support students of various disciplines and levels (18,19), they are heavily utilized in my classes to create a more inclusive and inviting environment. The groups are intentionally assigned by the instructor to promote inclusivity and allow for students of varying achievement levels to collaborate and learn from one another. This lesson employs think-pair-share, which allows for more meaningful class discussions as students take the time to critically think about a topic and exchange ideas with classmates before whole class discussion. Further, students write down their thoughts before class discussion, which eases anxieties for students who are uncomfortable with public speaking.

The use of technology is generally promoted in this course as assignments can be completed and submitted online, thus decreasing the environmental burdens associated with paper. However, as some students may not have a laptop or other classroom-friendly internet-connected device, instructors should print out a few copies of the assignments to accommodate all students. Students can submit their final work by emailing the instructor a photo of their completed assignment.

Biodiversity Show and Tell: An Accessible Activity to Encourage Students to Explore the Tree of Life,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2021.8,Lesson,2021,"Ecology, Evolution, Introductory Biology","Evolution, ecology, Biodiversity",Yes,"After completing their research, worksheets, and slides independently, students come together for a 50-minute discussion section to share the highlights of their species. This discussion is one of the most inclusive moments in the entire course because it brings together the perspectives of over 30 students instead of the perspective of one instructor. Many students choose to share species that interest them personally, so the presentations offer an opportunity for self-expression.

In our experience, the activity appears to foster a sense of community among the students as they learn about each other's interests and have fun together. However, giving the presentation can be intimidating for some students, especially those with anxiety or for whom English is a second language. For that reason, we structured the activity to support those students. When I (Stockwell) give the IAs directions on how to run the in-person version of the discussion section, I emphasize that they should let students present while sitting at their desks if they prefer. Students also have their worksheets in front of them and can read from them if they feel nervous about speaking spontaneously. The IA is in charge of projecting the students' slides so the students do not need to worry about the technology. The presentations are graded only on completion. With all those supports in place, the presentations represent a low-stakes way for students to practice the important skill of speaking in front of a group. If you have students with such severe anxiety that they cannot present even under these circumstances, you could offer them the opportunity to pre-record a presentation, as described in the online version of the activity.

The activity asks students to speak, listen, look, and (in the worksheet) write, thus offering many ways for students to engage their senses and demonstrate what they can do. Students get to hear about biodiversity from over 30 different perspectives, in over 30 different voices, and each student participates equally in the lesson. The result is a multifaceted, inclusive ""nature documentary"" created collaboratively by and for the students themselves.",341,,,,,

Past work by Eddie and Hogan (21) has revealed increasing class structure greatly reduces achievement gaps between black and white students and first-generation and continuing-generation students. Changing screen names in videoconferencing software to reflect pronouns acknowledges diversity in the classroom and normalizes the practice of sharing pronouns which may help make the synchronous classroom environment a more welcoming place.

Contact the department's instructional technology specialist for any recommendations for specific accommodations available in the computer labs. If personal computers are available or preferred, an internet connection and any program that manages data through spreadsheets will work to complete the lesson.

Access to a device that can take a photograph outside is a key component of this lesson. Ideally, a mobile device (such as a smartphone or tablet with satellite connection) with the iNaturalist application would be used. Accounts are free to create on iNaturalist. If mobile devices are prohibited or otherwise unavailable, observations may be made with digital cameras and uploaded through the iNaturalist website. Some colleges have cameras that can be loaned to the students, so it may be useful to check with departments whether these resources are available. The one important difference when using a digital camera to make observations is that students must record where they were when the photo was taken so that the observations can have associated geolocations (a process that is automatic with a mobile phone). A simplified data sheet can be created to encourage students to record this information while they are making observations (columns would include time of observation, photo file number, and location information). Students could also be encouraged to meet up with a partner for making the observations, which will reduce the burden for every student to have a device as well as promote collaboration and safety for work outside of class. Instructors can submit their students' observations as a compiled effort to maintain student anonymity and fulfill the goal of contributing to a public biodiversity database.

Schools may have restrictions on what applications and data students are allowed to share with respect to their coursework. If there are concerns, particularly about location sharing, there are some alternatives that allow students to participate without revealing identifying information. For example, the instructor might choose to create a single class iNaturalist account with their email address; the account would then be controlled by the instructor, but all students would be granted access to contribute observations. Instructors should monitor the account and change passwords if improper behavior is observed. More information on this adjustment can be found in the iNaturalist Teacher's Guide (26).

If possible, we encourage students to create their own accounts on iNaturalist so they may continue to be lifelong observers of nature and be more mindful of the natural world around them. Instructors should make no assessment-related comments on student observations within the iNaturalist platform, as that may be a violation of FERPA regulations. Students will always have the option of deleting their iNaturalist accounts (and all of the data they created) after the lesson is complete, if they choose to do so.

Utilizing data collected by local and global communities demonstrates to students the scale and scope of who participates and contributes to scientific data. Reciprocally, the students' efforts to record their observations extends beyond the classroom and into the broader community that can learn from and use their data for other projects. This activity also illustrates cultural diversity across neighborhoods, as different communities may support or cultivate different habitat types or species that influence the local diversity. Students collect independent data where they are or want to go; thus, the data represents the local areas and communities that students identify most with, rather than just the typical parks or recreation areas. Overall, the students are provided the opportunity to experience how science is accomplished through diverse participants and how through their contributions of observations, they become a part of that community of scientists.

Textbooks are the most commonly used resources for learning in classrooms but are often divisive for students who are not strong readers (1). The same can be said for review guides that are produced by instructors to be read and reviewed by students independently. Previous studies have shown that supplementation of text with study guides provides benefits both for students with learning disabilities and reading and language deficits, equalizing student achievement in the classroom (12). Additionally, I have anecdotally found that while minoritized students, introverted students, and students with accommodations are less likely to speak up in class, those groups participated well in the discussion-based study guide. This type of assignment gives the opportunities to ask anonymous questions without the influences of social stigmas or fear of public speaking, and allows students to perform at their own pace. This may create the opportunity for equal participation from all students in a low-pressure environment.",169,,,,,

Further, the unit leverages the diversity among students by providing multiple opportunities for every student in the class to share their work, thereby providing a voice to every student in the classroom.

In addition, using familiar objects (plastic building bricks) as the substrates and a human action in place of the enzyme may make the concept of enzyme kinetics more relatable and approachable. This simulation is performed in small groups, where students can play several roles in conducting the simulation (including timekeeper, data recorder, student ""enzyme"", or observer). Therefore, this activity could be modified to allow differently-abled students to participate depending on their needs by having the instructor and/or student group members discuss how all students can be involved prior to beginning the simulation. For example, in one of our classes, we had a visually impaired student who enjoyed being the ""enzyme"" because this kinesthetic activity doesn't require seeing the bricks.

This activity also provides multiple ways for students to answer questions about the material. When students complete the activity, they first answer questions in writing independently or in small groups, and then questions are discussed orally as a larger group. This technique allows all students to have the opportunity to participate. Structured discussion of individual student responses to the post-activity conceptual questions also allows students to teach each other.

Furthermore, nation-wide survey data indicates that barriers to integrating bioinformatics into undergraduate life sciences curriculum are disproportionately greater to faculty teaching at minority-serving institutions (MSIs) compared to faculty at non-MSIs (4). This disparity increases the value of engaging STEM undergraduates in computational bioinformatics, where there is evidence of a diversity gap. Additionally, this lesson can be effectively implemented in a traditional in person lab as well as a synchronous or asynchronous online formatted course.

The topic links easily to daily life, and students were encouraged to pursue ideas that were interesting to them and to bring materials from their home to test. Structure with clear goals and support has been shown to particularly improve learning in students belonging to groups underrepresented in the sciences (26-28). To this end, the goals of achieving mastery in the different science processes in order to prepare them for future classes and careers were explicitly stated to students at the start of the semester (including in the syllabus, Supporting File S1. Bioactive Compounds – Syllabus) and when transitioning between modules. That learning is a process and that skills build over time was also explicitly stated to the students in every lab session. The emphasis on growth was enacted in every class where students were provided with support and sufficient in-class time to plan their experiment, to learn to use Excel, to make a graph, to perform statistical analysis, and to write up their work as a lab report and to prepare their presentation. The lab report was guided with built-in instructions for the individual elements (e.g., Supporting File S12. Bioactive compounds – Module 1. Lab 4. Guided lab report). Students had time to work on different parts of the lab report during class over several weeks. Information needed to complete a task was provided before class as part of homework assignments. Sessions started with a whole class discussion of daily tasks from the homework, followed by demonstration of any laboratory techniques. All assignments were considered formative: students were given feedback on how they might improve their work and then given the opportunity to make said improvements. Since they used the same or similar skills over the course of the four modules, students had the opportunity to grow their skills and improve throughout the semester – and explicitly recognize that in self-reflections.

Group work was also structured to support the success of all students centering around the principles of positive interdependence, individual accountability, and equal and simultaneous interaction (29). Students were individually accountable by completing their own individual assignments that prepared them for a class session or as they learned new skills during class. Being individually accountable at every stage of the research process prepared students to participate equally and productively during group interactions. Group work relied on positive interdependence, as students needed each other both for the overall success of the project as well as for tasks that were complicated enough to elicit mutual need (29-31). Specifically, students worked in groups of four for cognitively difficult tasks that benefit from multiple inputs such as planning the experiment or discussing experimental results. For performing the experiment or recording the results, students worked in smaller groups of two to allow both students to be fully engaged. For example, often both students worked on the experiment together, while in other cases the two students had specific, complementary tasks of either completing or recording results. Successful group interactions in this Lesson were also supported by clear goals, tasks being highly relevant to the goal, and outcomes in the form of lab reports or presentations with multiple parts that clearly linked to future value in their science careers (31). Active learning in general has been shown to support inclusive learning by all students (32). CUREs implemented early in the curriculum have been shown to improve scientific self-efficacy, identity, and student persistence in STEM degrees among diverse students (11,33) and hold particular promise for underrepresented minority students (33-35).

At the end of the four-week lab exercise, each student pair shares their data in the form of an oral presentation, making each group’s contribution of equal importance. Using this format overcomes significant barriers and gives students an ability to see themselves and their peers as scientists (23). Each student pair is required to adjust the given protocol to carry out the experiment they design, troubleshooting any problems they encounter as if they were working in a research laboratory. This approach encourages the less-vocal students to actively participate in figuring out how to successfully complete the laboratory exercises (24). Students help each other, which leads to minimal instructor intervention. For both the written lab report and in-class oral presentation, students continue to work with their lab partner, which functions to reduce writing and presentation anxiety. An additional element that enhances lab performance is how the students pair up with each other. At the beginning of the semester, students are free to choose their partner. Since this lab activity is towards the end of the semester, the student pairs have worked together in many lab exercises and have developed an excellent rapport with each other. Furthermore, every student has access to the same time and resources throughout the activity ensuring that no students have a preparation advantage.

This online lab course is highly-structured because it contains pre-lab learning with opportunities for feedback, frequent feedback on thinking and writing in the form of laboratory notebooks, peer-instruction during lab sessions, multiple summative assessments, and opportunities to demonstrate mastery in multiple modes, including writing, take-home tests, as well as oral presentations. Providing students with the opportunity to frequently work at their own pace ensures that those who need differing amounts of time with material have this access (see comments about take-home tests in ""Assessment""). Also, accommodating students who have unavoidable conflicts with live video conferencing lab sessions is important in creating an inclusive environment. We emphasized flexibility in this course, encouraging students to participate in the live lab sessions as often as they could but accommodating when they could not (over 90% of students were in the live sessions, all quarter long). We allowed for missed sessions and time to make-up missed lab notebook entries when inevitable conflicts arose such as sick family members or students, work conflicts (some students picked up extra shifts to supplement their family's income), anxiety and depression exacerbated as a result of the pandemic and civil uprising. Many of us took a mastery approach to grading, e.g., weighting the lowest scoring take-home quiz lower than the highest scoring quiz, and using a score of 85% or higher on lower stakes items as a cutoff for full points.

When creating lab discussion breakout groups, some instructors created groups to ensure that there were no gender imbalances or, for example, one student from a traditionally under-represented background being the only under-represented student in their group. Some instructors randomly assigned groups each week, providing opportunities for students to meet more peers and be exposed to more diverse ways of thinking and working. Further, assigning roles to different group members each week ensured that all students had opportunities to speak, report, and be heard by their peers.

Lastly, providing opportunities to engage in a lab course online may increase accessibility for students who normally are unable to participate because of disability, geography, or other constraints. For this reason, it may be worth considering offering online versions of a lab course even when instruction returns face-to-face.

Students work collaboratively throughout the semester as they use authentic microbiology and genomics techniques that closely align with epidemiological investigations conducted by the FDA, CDC, and other public health laboratories. Student research has the potential for discovery and to make contributions to the field (33 and E. Gline, E. Gross, B. Puma, R. Zoldork, M. Thinnes, E. Seracino, and J. B. Herrick. Presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, Virginia Branch, 8 to 9 November 2019). Through active engagement in authentic practices via wet lab and/or computer-based activities, students gain an understanding of the nature of “real world” scientific endeavors in the field, and also experience autonomy, project ownership, and how to navigate challenges in a research setting.

Other design features of the CURE lend well to inclusive teaching practices. In studying the socially relevant topics of foodborne pathogens and antibiotic resistance in their own community, this lesson would be broadly meaningful to students of varying backgrounds and professional interests (e.g., medicine, epidemiology, bioinformatics, infectious disease microbiology). Pedagogical approaches implemented in this lesson accommodate a variety of learning styles and ability through demonstrations, mini-lectures, videos, hands-on laboratory and computer-based activities, worksheets, discussions, and optional additional tutorials.

Fostering such experiences promotes inclusion of all team members while using a highly adaptable active learning technique (32). Inclusion in science underscores the collaborative nature of the discipline. The essential points of evidence-based teaching seek to provide a resource for designing an inclusive teaching experience for the classroom (33). Importantly, the social relationships developed during the dialogue discussing this case among groups promotes an environment where the knowledge of each participant is heard (32). In particular, students can empathize with the patient, Gary, the researcher or the students engaging in the data analysis portions of the case. This crucial component promotes diversity through the active learning experience (34). The inclusive dialogues and relationship between characters within the case has students navigating the informatic activities as they explicitly address emerging developments within the field of informatics and molecular biology. Moreover, this dialogue between both characters and students promotes engagement and trains self-efficacy when navigating large data sets associated with biological enquiry.

Students may leverage their own experiences in exploring potential paths of inquiry and, through the lens of healthcare, can engage in discussions about equity within healthcare contexts.

Exploring Miracle Fruit: An Undergraduate Laboratory Exercise on Experimental Design,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2021.29,Lesson,2021,"Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Science Process Skills","sensory systems, pH, Protein shape, Taste",Yes,"Many factors are likely to affect an individual student’s exposure to experimental design inside and outside of the classroom. These include, but are not limited to, socioeconomic status and first-generation status. Instructors of upper-level courses might assume that students have a refined understanding of experimental design by that point in their education. However, depending on the quality of introductory courses that students have experienced, this may not be the case. The same is true with respect to the inequities among first-year students and their high school courses. The miraculin activity does not make assumptions as to a student’s level of experimental design experience. It seeks to correct misconceptions and encourages peer support. Additionally, students are encouraged to share their past experience or inexperience with experimental design. Students are given many opportunities and contexts in which to express their knowledge, questions, and concerns. They can express their knowledge in a written manner via pre-lab questions (Supporting File S4: Miracle Fruit: Pre-lab Questions), the laboratory protocol (Supporting File S5: Miracle Fruit: Laboratory Protocol), and the post-activity reflection survey (Supporting File S3: Miracle Fruit: Exit Survey). They can also share knowledge verbally with the instructor one-on-one or during a class discussion. They express their knowledge to peers both within and outside of their lab groups. Therefore, students can choose to whom, when, and in what format they share what they have learned. The level of student choice exhibited throughout the experimental design process allows students to tailor their learning in a way that makes sense to them, promoting inclusivity by allowing different students to learn and experience the activity in different ways. Particularly, this contributes to inclusivity for students with disabilities because it gives them the opportunity to express information in ways that work for them. For example, choosing to present ideas verbally rather than in writing may help students with certain disabilities. On the other hand, students with disabilities related to interpersonal interactions can choose to express their ideas in writing. In general, active learning increases performance of underrepresented and first-generation students by a larger margin than other students (16). Since this activity contains many elements of active learning, it should therefore contribute to inclusivity.

Additionally, the activity allows students to bring their cultural experiences into the classroom and share them with their classmates. For example, students are encouraged to bring in foods that are culturally relevant to them. This shows students the importance of representative sampling in experimental designs. By giving students freedom, the activity encourages them to challenge dominant narratives in science. For example, students from non-Western backgrounds may identify variables or design flaws that Westernized science might miss. This could generate a class discussion after the activity about the relationship between experimental design, diversity, Westernization, and drawing conclusions.",458,,,,,

As students assume roles as a family member, clinician, or researcher, they can envision the situation and questions that these historical or contemporary figures face(d) and how their decisions impacted both scientific advances and the advent of bioethics. This requires students to assume perspectives which they may not have otherwise considered and weigh evidence that shapes or informs their own perspectives during the post-class reflection. Moreover, role-playing activities help students as they explore the diversity of science through not only the foundational knowledge, but also the people involved in making the science; this helps students connect to the learning experience (27). An inclusive experience incorporates race, ethnicity, and gender (29), which are all nested components of this case. Together, this collaborative effort seeks to acknowledge diverse perspectives and, through collaboration with peers, have students examine scientists and participants from a variety of backgrounds to enrich learning through inclusive practice.

Targeting Misconceptions in the Central Dogma by Examining Viral Infection,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2021.31,Lesson,2021,"Genetics, Introduction Biology","data, transcription, virus, translation, protein function, membrane transport, Predictions",Yes,"This lesson aims to foster an inclusive learning environment through the use of a variety of different methods of student engagement including the student worksheet, projected slides, and both instructor-led and student-led discussions. Using a variety of strategies engages a broader population of students (22). Students engage in multiple-choice clicker questions both individually and with class discussion, and in think-pair-share questions. Having students discuss with peers before sharing to the entire class helps to minimize student discomfort by allowing them to talk one-on-one with peers as opposed to speaking in front of the entire class, thus still encouraging students to collaborate and discourages competition (22). Whole class discussion in the “share” portion of the think-pair-share can be enhanced and made more equitable by calling on a variety of groups/individuals or quickly going around in a “whip around” (22). Students designed their own hypothesis and experiment, predicted the results through drawing, and observed and interpreted original data. This allowed students to be creative in their scientific approach and also explore previously published literature.",172,,,,,
From Dirt to Streptomyces DNA,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2021.32,Lesson,2021,Microbiology,"Metabolism, Antibiotic production, rRNA genes, Secondary metabolites, Streptomyces",Yes,"Inclusive teaching requires that students feel comfortable in your classroom. “Being explicit about one’s goal of cultivating an inclusive, equitable, and fair classroom learning environment reiterates that students and instructors are on the same side, not on somehow opposing sides, of the teaching and learning process” and “all students are explicitly welcomed into the intellectual discussion of biology” (28). Emphasize to your students that you, as the instructor, are committed to an inclusive classroom environment. To ensure inclusiveness tell your students that the course is structured in such a way to facilitate this outcome. Impress upon your students that scientific investigation is a collaborative effort that requires multiple inputs and talents. Tell them we each bring unique abilities and experiences to any situation, and that our success, as a class, on the Streptomyces project requires that each person contribute and that we as a class value each other’s unique contribution and perspective. Remind your students that it is your hope, as their instructor, that all of them will become the next generation of scientific investigators committed to the scientific method and evidence-based decision making. Tell them that they will become the diverse face of the next generation of scientists (28).

In addition, as the instructor, it is important that you recognize the diversity in your classroom. Your class’s diversity may include some of the following differences: race, class, poverty, gender, disability, and privilege or disenfranchisement (29). Before asking students to introduce themselves and identify diversity issues important to them you, as their instructor, can provide a comfortable classroom environment by introducing yourself to the class. Describe your background and diversity issues you deem important to create an inclusive classroom environment. You might also include a diversity statement in your syllabus.

Once you have initiated the discussion on diversity encourage your students to introduce themselves to the class at the beginning of the semester. Give them a chance to say who they are and what they hope to gain and give to the class. In addition, students should be encouraged to speak to you privately to assess their learning, progress, and concerns for the class. You should also ask them, during an office meeting, about their learning style, do they work best alone, or in a group. Do they excel at oral or written work? Let them know that you are available to meet with them in person, during office hours, or by email correspondence. Tell them that the class will provide an opportunity for them to participate and excel in different ways and that you want them to tell you if they are uncomfortable, for any reason, during class and what things you as the instructor can do to facilitate their learning. In short, they matter to you as individuals.

Students work in groups of 2-4. This establishes a small community of learners in which each student can feel safe and included. I assign members to each group based on my prior knowledge of their prior research experience and observation of their engagement with their major. Some students have extensive out of class research experience, and these students should not group together. If students self-select the groups become homogenous and therefore do not reflect the diversity of the classroom.

As an example of an inclusive learning environment during LAB 3 and 4, students examine each other's work and then decide together which of their soil isolates most closely resembles a Streptomyces bacterium.  These groups prepare a short in-lab presentation that gives each student a voice. It allows students who might be reluctant to speak to the entire class by themselves, to be part of a supportive group presentation that represents their work. This allows students with different learning styles (interactive group work as opposed to individual noninteractive work) to benefit from an interactive learning environment. This opportunity arises several times during the semester when students present their hypotheses regarding their group’s laboratory work and their data. This Lesson also employs peer instruction which promotes an inclusive environment as each student brings different skills to the group and therefore adds value to each person’s contribution.

Finally, as the instructor, you should take time to point out the diversity among Streptomyces investigators. Hopwood’s Streptomyces in Nature and Medicine (8) provides an excellent resource documenting this point and the power of cooperative scientific investigation. I cannot emphasize enough how useful and important Hopwood’s book is, as a resource, and to impress upon students the diversity inherent in the international Streptomyces project. The text highlights the international cooperation, among female and male scientists of different nationalities, brought together at the John Innes Centre in England. Individual investigators are described and given credit for their contributions. The book demonstrates the power of both diversity and cooperative investigation. I point out to students the names of individuals who contributed to the International Streptomyces project. For example, Hee-Jeon Hong from Korea working with Mark Buttner, from the John Innes Center in Norwich UK, discover one pathway for resistance to the antibiotic vancomycin (8, 30) and Janet Westpheling working with Xianyang Ni, from the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia who together examine the promoter region of the Streptomyces chitinase gene (8, 15). These are not household names, but they are known in Streptomyces biology and demonstrate to students the diversity and collaborative nature of scientific investigation. There are many more examples and I strongly encourage you to obtain a copy of this book.

In class, we talk about how spatial abilities are typically lower in female students due in part to the toys and games females are introduced to as children. This slow development of spatial ability has been linked to lower retention and success in STEM (18, 19). Ideally these models will help those with low spatial ability train their brains to build a more robust mental model and therefore increase their success and retention in STEM programs. Additionally, the models are in CPK colors which should be accessible to those with color blindness.

In this lesson, we present a hands-on introduction to modeling and computational biology, enabling participation for a broader range of physical abilities. The hybrid approach of independent work followed by group discussion allows students to move at their own pace and develop their own ideas and hypotheses prior to discussion. This approach also allows students to develop their own thoughts, explain their thinking, and evaluate other suggestions collaboratively. We also present concepts using a variety of forms, including visually through model interfaces, textually through model descriptions and written protocols, and audibly through lectures allowing for concept reinforcement and participation with different learning styles.

Each participant has a handout (Supporting File S1. Active Learning Workshop – Worksheet) with all question prompts for them to answer and space to take notes. Everyone completes the quick write questions individually. In a gallery walk, participants work in small groups at different stations to discuss questions and write their responses. After a few minutes, the groups rotate to a new station with a different question and change scribes to allow equitable contributions from the group members. This process is repeated until all groups have rotated through all questions.

Every participant is also responsible for reading their assigned article prior to the workshop in preparation for the jigsaw activity. In a jigsaw, participants first form expert groups with members who have read the same article to discuss the takeaways and respond to questions based on their assigned article. Afterward, they form new reshuffled groups with members that have read different articles; each member then teaches their article to their peers in their new groups. The jigsaw format is both equitable and inclusive as everyone is responsible and held accountable for their learning and teaching (20).

We also use unbiased call in this workshop to solicit ideas from the participants, tracking who has spoken to make sure that the most voices are heard (18, 21, 22). To increase participants’ comfort with unbiased call and to decrease anxiety, we always give the participants a chance to discuss their answers with their peers prior to calling on them (18). Questions in several workshop activities also address strategies on ensuring equitable participation and/or creating an inclusive classroom that engages everyone (Supporting File S1.

This lesson ties traditional scientific understanding directly to issues of social justice in ways that are likely to benefit student success throughout their development (45). Alignment of teaching and assessment by awarding points on the exam communicates the moral and ethical value of social justice through STEM learning (46). The material is taught actively to help include students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds and reduce the achievement gaps (47). This is done primarily through a POGIL structure (48). Course instructors and teaching staff strive to teach in a personable, caring way to create an atmosphere of learning that can help to break down historic barriers to access and retention for marginalized communities (49–51). Notes available to students before class made clear that topics of racial justice would be discussed, and we note that including this kind of language in course syllabi may help some students from historically marginalized communities reduce the anxiety associated with being a student of color at a predominantly White institution discussing social justice topics.

However, the lesson does try to promote two other aspects of inclusive teaching: making space for students’ voices and making expectations as clear as possible.

Modules B and C of the lesson are well-suited for group discussions, in part because they include problems too complex for some students to solve individually. Group work can potentially lead to meaningful interactions among group members (20), which might increase students’ sense of belonging in the classroom (21). A variation of Module C (noted in the “Possible Modifications” subsection of the Teaching Discussion below) offers additional discussion opportunities regarding the “race coefficient” in equations for estimating GFR, which may disadvantage Black kidney failure patients relative to non-Black patients.

The lesson might also be considered inclusive in the sense that TQTs potentially provide students with transparent alignment of learning activities and test questions (15). This transparency of expectations should be especially helpful to students who are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with high-stakes testing, students who lack test-savvy study partners, and students for whom reading and writing in English is difficult.

This lesson has been adapted to accommodate students who cannot draw but are able to type or use talk-to-text communication devices.

In addition to engaging multiple types of students, the cystic fibrosis case study emphasizes diversity of genetic variation in genomic medicine. The prevalence of cystic fibrosis varies among different populations (1 in 3,500 in Caucasian Americans, 1 in 17,000 in African Americans, and 1 in 31,000 in Asian Americans) (8). Studies have shown that there are 1,700+ genetic variations that have been associated with cystic fibrosis, all with varying allele frequencies. Historically, the studies that classified these variant types were heavily skewed towards studies that focused on Caucasian populations. However, recent studies have shown that the frequency of these variants in non-Caucasian populations is variable (9). Furthermore, novel variants that are not present in Caucasian populations have been identified in non-Caucasian cystic fibrosis patients. Despite these recent findings, screening panels designed to test for cystic fibrosis variants are largely based upon the variants identified from the original studies of Caucasian populations (10). This lesson engages students in a discussion on the implications of study bias in medical research through an examination of the frequency of these variants in non-Caucasian populations.

Increasing the structure of a classroom in this way benefits all students, but especially those who are first generation or racial minorities (31). The jigsaw format minimizes the chances of one student dominating conversation within a small group (32). Each course activity also begins with an opportunity for students to think through the material on their own, which ensures that students are engaged in the material before joining small groups for discussion. Finally, the synthesis groups start their discussion with a “whip around” (33) – each student sharing out their answers to their group – to ensure that each student has the chance to present.

After working together for weeks, students become comfortable with their peers, which creates a more interactive and positive environment (19). When students select their groups, they get started on the project more quickly as the time needed to get to know one another is reduced (20), which could lead to increased productivity and even creativity. Students will employ a variety of techniques in this activity, including: generation of single cells that are then plated, cell counting, staining, and microscopy, which will engage all types of learners. Group work allows for students to teach one another, which is an effective pedagogy tool. For example, a student proficient in microscope work can help other members of the group that may be intimidated or unsure of how to use such equipment. In terms of assessments, the small homework assignments are designed to help the students gather and organize the information that needs to be incorporated into the lab report, which can set the students up for success on the formative assessment. Additionally, feedback provided to each student on the small homework assignments directly addresses each individual's background and preferences. Lastly, since the formative assessment is a written lab report, students who have anxiety around test-taking or oral presentations will have an opportunity to boost their grade in this course through this assignment.

Using Seafood Traceability to Teach the Complexities of Natural Resource Management and Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2020.10,Lesson,2020,Ecology,"sustainability, fisheries, aquaculture, Anthropogenic Impacts, Natural Resource Management",Yes,"The incorporation of classroom activities on both days of this two-day lesson plan is meant to engage undergraduate students in meaningful ways that will increase student learning (16). The goal of these classroom activities is to stimulate critical thinking on issues related to natural resource management and environmental sustainability. Specifically, the Seafood Watch activity on Day 1 uses small-group learning and the stakeholder analysis activity on Day 2 uses role-play and think-pair-share. Our use of the think-pair-share technique in the stakeholder assessment allows us to be inclusive of students who prefer individual work as well as students who prefer group work. Importantly, this allows students who are intimidated by group work to have a moment to work on their own (i.e., think) and build up confidence (i.e., pair) before reporting to the larger group (i.e., share).

We also use place-based examples to illustrate some of the seafood traceability issues. Overall, the issue of seafood sustainability is already economically relevant to the state of Rhode Island where marine-based industries form a large sector of the economy. Using images of local restaurants and other stakeholders in the presentation slides increased the place-based nature of the lesson plan. Similarly, basing the Seafood Watch activity off a menu from a local seafood restaurant enhanced the authenticity of the activity. Accordingly, we encourage instructors to locate a menu from a local seafood restaurant for their own classes. Some student populations may be significantly less connected to seafood for cultural and/or geographic reasons. In this case, the best approach for connecting to these students may be through the use of fast food examples. Many popular fast food chains have seafood items on the menu, with varying levels of disclosure regarding from where they are sourced (e.g., imported shrimp vs. Alaskan Pollock vs. North Pacific cod). Instructors could modify the Seafood Watch Activity such that students are asked to compare seafood options from multiple fast food chains.

Depending on the instructor, students can self-select their groups, be randomly placed, or assigned groups to include students from diverse (race, gender, and ethnicity, completed courses) backgrounds. The design of this module facilitates that each group member must contribute and acquire skills to work effectively in a team and accomplish the set tasks within a defined time period. They learn to support each other and work as a team while brainstorming, designing experiments, during the hands-on parts of the lab and for their oral presentation. As the instructor, we ensure that every group member is engaged – in discussing, micropipetting, capturing images, analyzing data, and preparing the final presentation – by monitoring student interactions. We discourage student isolation.

During class discussions, some students might wonder why cancer cells are not being used. One strategy is to inform students about HeLa, an immortalized cell line, derived from the cervical cancer of an African-American woman, Henrietta Lacks. HeLa cells are used for biomedical research world-wide and have been taken into space. Students can be encouraged to read ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" by Rebecca Skloot (8). HeLa cells would have been ideal for this module. However, during our initial testing, we found the HeLa cells would detach from the slide as they divided. Thus, only a few cells in mitosis are observed. In contrast, the PtK2 cells remain attached during cell division and all mitotic stages can be observed.

This lesson aims to aid with cultural preconceived notions about vaccination, which are prevalent in the minority populations from which the students originate (14). This lesson provides a way to discuss vaccination with students who may have misconceptions. The lesson begins with a show of hands of when students think the vaccine will prevent disease spread. The informal poll shows students that they are not alone in their opinion, whatever it happens to be. As people differ in their beliefs about vaccination, discussion starts with the influenza vaccine because this is a vaccine that many people do not receive and there are a multitude of reasons used. This example has an added benefit as students have not been uncomfortable discussing their choice. However, an anonymous poll could be done online (for example, using Kahoot) to answer the questions 1) did you receive the influenza vaccine (flu shot)? 2) why or why not? 3) do you believe your choice affects others? We find that starting here establishes commonality and avoids exclusion of students whom may differ in their beliefs toward vaccination.

Throughout the activities, students work in small assigned groups of three to four. Assignment of these groups is based on student self-identified asset maps (20). This is an approach that has been shown to enhance equity and inclusion in group work (20). They are encouraged to share their strengths and challenges regarding the material and communicate how they will work as a group to achieve full participation for all group members. Students discuss the research article using a ""whip-around,"" which is an inclusive pedagogy approach that has been shown to enhance student engagement and cultivate equity in the classroom (21,22). This requires each student to share their understanding of background information on muscle development and of the results for myf5 expression in axolotl embryos within a supportive environment. The use of focus questions to structure text reading and multiple active learning approaches provides opportunities for all students to be supported in their learning. Since no prior knowledge of muscle development or myf5 is required, all students are able to participate in developing a hypothesis, performing the experiment and analyzing results. Throughout the exercise I encourage students to share ideas and questions in order to learn from one another, since each student has different areas of expertise, both knowledge and skill-wise, to contribute.

We take care to form diverse student groups for laboratory exercises early in the term by considering a variety of factors and characteristics (e.g., student major, class rank, gender, interest, experience in the field, etc.) In our experience, students often opt to work with their laboratory partners or groups during the lecture. This helps to ensure that each collaborative group includes a variety of viewpoints and experiences, which should increase the quality of the peer interactions that occur during the collaborative portion of the activity, as well as the activity responses that are submitted. As there are no single correct or incorrect answers to this learning task, all students are provided the opportunity to identify and describe activities from the course that they personally perceive to have been supportive of their achievement of the CLOs. The collaborative nature of the exercise facilitates the sharing of alternative examples of activities from the course that might also have been beneficial regarding outcome achievement. In this way, students are potentially exposed to connections and patterns of thinking that they may not otherwise have ever identified.

BioVEDA Curriculum: An Approach to Link Conceptual and Quantitative Understanding of Variation During Experimental Design and Data Analysis,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2020.16,Lesson,2020,Science Process Skills,"statistics, sample size, Biological variation",Yes,"A primary goal for this set of activities is to connect conceptual and quantitative thinking by exploring variation. This approach inherently includes multiple strategies to learning about the topic, a recommended approach for creating an inclusive learning environment for diverse learners (15,17). We embraced this quality by using different formats for student activities. For example, the activities begin with a whole class discussion, followed by a writing activity done in pairs, generating a pictorial representation, and generation of mathematical expressions on whiteboards in small groups. By incorporating multiple types of representations (pictorial, mathematical, graphical) and formats for students to explain their ideas (individual writing, peer discussion, whole class discussion) into the activities, we hope to broaden engagement to students who may value multiple representations or who may respond to different activity formats.

An added benefit of the formats we selected is that they are designed to foster a sense of collaboration among students. In the activities, students have discussions to select experimental design strategies used by the entire class section, pool data to explore sample size's effect on variation, and create pictorial and quantitative expression in groups, in class, with instructor feedback and discussion. All of these activities are designed with collaboration and consensus building in mind. Strategies to increase cooperation and decrease competition, like the ones used in these activities, tend to increase student achievement and feelings of engagement (18,19). This is especially important in a lab setting, where traditional lab formats may create a sense of competition among students trying to complete a prescribed experiment in parallel to other students. In addition, recent evidence has shown that collaborative lab activities help eliminate achievement gaps based on previous science experience and science career interest, which can vary widely among introductory undergraduate students for whom these activities are designed (20).",299,,,,,

Quieter students are provided a solitary moment to think individually while students who prefer verbal processing are able to do so with peers and the class. The artistic nature of this lesson provides opportunities for creative students to use their artistic skills, which can sometimes be overlooked in the science classroom. Finally, the fact that these drawings can be designed and analyzed in multiple different ways celebrates the diversity of thought that is important in science. The fact that there is no 100% right answer helps students understand that science indeed requires creativity.

Assessing Urban Biodiversity With the eBird Citizen Science Project: A Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) Module,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2020.18,Lesson,2020,"Ecology, Science Process Skills","data, citizen science, community, Biodiversity, Species, hypothesis, habitat",Yes,"A large body of evidence indicates undergraduate research experiences increase inclusivity in science education (1,2,3,8,9,10). To enhance the impact of the CURE model, I integrated group work throughout the module, encouraging students to divide tasks in ways that took advantage of diverse skill sets. For example, in the field students worked in pairs or small groups to collect data. Individuals more comfortable managing binoculars would spot birds while record keepers consulted Merlin Bird ID and kept notes.

When setting up experimental design and working groups, instructors must keep in mind time constraints, transportation needs, and mobility limitations that might affect students. For group projects, an important challenge is scheduling time outside of class when all members of the group are available. Field work, which must be amenable to a variety of factors including weather conditions, further complicates this effort. For this reason, I set aside dedicated class time for field data collection. When groups collected data at off-campus sites, we organized carpools to ensure everyone had a ride. For most of my students, mobility was not a limitation for walking transects. Also, some of our sites were wheel-chair accessible. However, as mentioned earlier walking transects is only one method of sampling. Spot-sampling, where the group remains in one place and records birds over a set period, is another option.

In situations where students cannot participate in group fieldwork, alternative plans should be developed. For example, one of my students was on maternity leave during the field work portion of the CURE project. Instead of joining an assigned group, she collected her own data on residential birds in her neighborhood. She then rejoined the class for data analysis, group discussion, and the final reports at the end of the semester. Many approaches can be taken to implementing this module. In the interests of inclusion, it is important to remain flexible and avoid a one-size-fits-all mindset.

As a citizen science platform with global reach, eBird appealed to all my students, who represented diverse racial, ethnic, economic, and international backgrounds. At the start of this project, none of my students had worked with birds, and some were skeptical of the project objectives. By the end of the semester, all had gained from and enjoyed the experience, as evidenced by assessment results as well as informal and formal feedback (see Teaching Discussion, below).

We incorporated effective team-based learning (TBL) methods (10,11) by designing all in-lab activities around small, permanent student teams who work together to formulate hypotheses and then collect, analyze, and interpret data. Students conduct brief reflective writing assignments outside of class between lab sessions to ensure that their effort on these exercises is not time-limited (9). In the fourth week, we use a modified “jigsaw” design to promote cooperative learning among students with different backgrounds (12) and empower students to apply their knowledge to solve relevant problems (13) in environmental conservation and management. The challenges are open-ended with no “right” answer and require that students consider socially and culturally diverse issues relevant to resource management. After students work in teams to discuss an assigned scenario, they come together as a class so that each team is prepared to explain and defend a unique scenario (i.e., a team-based “jigsaw” design). This approach allows students to present their vetted solutions in the context of a supportive team, while also being exposed to alternative perspectives and ideas developed by other teams that addressed different scenarios.",201,,,,,

Studies have shown that problem solving and work done in groups enhances learning (44-47) and benefits from diverse contributing perspectives (48-50). In particular, an examination of collegiate student group work demonstrated that racio-ethnic diversity was positively related to group efficacy (51).

Additionally, educational research has shown that applied laboratory experiences increase interest in science by traditionally underrepresented populations in the sciences by demonstrating the relevance of the course material (11). In particular, including content related to social justice issues such as health disparities has been shown to increase minority engagement and persistence (52), which may be one of the many reasons the AAAS encourages courses to connect science to society more directly (12). This lesson has very overt relevance and highlights the importance of considering developmental biology in discussions about environmental issues when students observe the impact of pesticide exposure on organogenesis (followed by more focused and personally-relevant experiments in the Independent Experiment portion). It also has the opportunity to be connected to issues of social justice around access to quality water and the link between this access and public health outcomes. Readings from the 2010 book, Living Downstream: An ecologist's personal investigation of cancer and the environment (53) or scenes from the documentary based on this book, could be a way to stimulate conversation about this connection. This CURE reinforces the value of a course project and demonstrates how coursework can be connected to broader issues students may care about. In fact, CUREs are recommended as a mechanism for making scientific research more inclusive because they grant access to meaningful research experiences for all students (16). While some particularly recommend establishing CURE programs at minority serving institutions (54), establishing CUREs at any undergraduate institution has the potential to enhance the interest and persistence of students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields.",328,,,,,

During our first in-class discussion, I use a set of integrated culturally-responsive mentoring and teaching strategies for student-centered and place-based teaching (16,18,19,21). Dr. Geneva Gay defines culturally-responsive teaching as ""...using cultural knowledge, prior experiences, frames of references, and performance styles of ethnically diverse students to make learning encounters more relevant and effective for them. It teaches to and through the strengths of these students"" (18). The culturally-responsive mentoring and teaching approach applies Dr. Gregory Cajete's concept of the creative process instructional model (16). Dr. Cajete mentions that ""In Native American cultures, science and art are complementary dimensions of the community mind. This subtle yet profound relationship becomes apparent only when one focuses upon the processes of thought as opposed to its end products. It is, therefore, my contention that one can use art to teach science, and science to teach art, and cultural philosophy to teach both"" (16). The creative cycle contains three steps: 1.) provide frame of reference for students; 2.) utilize principles, themes, and classification approaches in both Native American and Western cultural science; and 3.) integrate both Native American and Western scientific approaches. The cyclical flow allows for deeper understanding of a scientific process and broader perspective on a specific concept in science. Here, the creative process cycle starts by linking cultural relevance of a developmental process. As we explore and discuss the cross-cultural dimensions and ethics on congenital heart defects in the greater Yakima Valley, we link the affective learning dimensions and explore in-depth the process of the molecular and cellular process of developmental biology. For example, before I began discussions on Cre/LoxP and fate mapping experiments, I engaged students in a community classroom discussion on articles that highlight emerging incidences of congenital heart diseases in the homeland of Yakama Nation, as well as the greater Yakima Valley of Washington State. Upon reading these articles, students explored how topics discussed in heart development and Cre/LoxP research in zebrafish heart cell lineages are linked to providing future insights into congenital heart diseases. Once the importance of how investigating heart development is linked to the health of our community, we then began to discuss the molecular and cellular aspects of heart development and the function of Cre/LoxP technology in fate mapping experiments on the in-class worksheet.

In addition, students work in small, collaborative groups throughout the module and share expertise amongst themselves. In these situations, students of diverse backgrounds often find comfort and develop camaraderie with others as they are able to use their strengths and bolster their weaknesses in a collaborative setting. Finally, the breadth of the activities in this module promote inclusive learning through stimulation of multiple modalities.

Such equal access to research experiences may help women and minorities overcome the structural barriers that reduce their numbers in the sciences (22). Participation in a CURE has been linked to student gains in research skills, self-efficacy, and persistence in science (23-25). Additionally, our CURE modules are implemented through a national network that not only creates broad-scale datasets, but will also help students feel a sense of belonging to a scientific community outside their class, as well as validation for contributions to this broader community (26).

In this specific lesson, a variety of strategies, such as think-pair-share, multiple hands, multiple voices (i.e., requiring multiple raised hands or responses to a question before any responses are shared), and whip around are used to foster participation of all students in discussion activities (20). While inclusive instruction is sometimes difficult in field sciences, this lesson provides ample opportunity for including students with disabilities. Because sciurids are broadly distributed across diverse natural and urban habitats and are present on nearly all university and college campuses in North America (27) this lesson can be implemented in locations that allow participation of students with mobility disabilities. Additionally, because data collection requires both listening to radio telemetry receivers and visually locating sciurids or their sign (i.e., nests, burrows), collaboration of students in small groups allows participation of students with either visual or hearing impairments during field activities. This lesson can also provide flexibility in how activities are conducted outside of class. As an extension option, students sign-up to track radio-collared sciurids outside of class by choosing times that fit their schedules, thereby avoiding timing conflicts with work or family obligations.

When participating in these activities, students work collaboratively in small groups (of 3-5 students that they select) on several formative assessments, which provides them with the opportunity to make their voices heard, draw on each other's strengths, and assist each other with data interpretation (47). The small group questions are either discussed as an entire class or asked about in follow up clicker questions (Supporting File S1. Speciation and Conservation – Presentation Slides with Instructor Notes; Supporting File S2. Speciation and Conservation – Discussion After Application Worksheet Activity). Students earn points for participating in the clicker questions and are not scored based on selecting the correct answer. This grading policy supports the message that students should think about the questions and get help when they are incorrect, rather than worry about the grade. More information about using this scoring scheme can be found in a recent review about using clicker questions in biology courses (48). For the summative assessment, we employed a two-stage exam design (49,50) at the end of the semester, where students first answer the questions as individuals, turn in their individual answers, and then work in small randomly-assigned groups to answer the questions again. The group part inspired lively discussions where students explain their thinking and provided each other with immediate feedback.

We also designed the lesson to emphasize diverse perspectives and frame speciation in a way that endeavors to be both relevant and engaging. Before the start of the lesson, students are asked to submit photos of animals that are symbolically significant to their own cultures or identities, which are then incorporated into the lecture slides (Slide 13 of Supporting File S1. Speciation and Conservation – Presentation Slides with Instructor Notes). This assignment has several potential benefits, including that students feel valued in seeing their chosen animal represented on the slide and learn about their peers' backgrounds. To build upon this personal investment, we focused our lesson around the giraffe, which invites strong public engagement from communities and conservationists across the globe.

To be mindful of students who may have a color vision deficiency, we carefully designed the figures in the slides (Supporting File S1. Speciation and Conservation – Presentation Slides with Instructor Notes; Supporting File S2. Speciation and Conservation – Discussion After Application Worksheet Activity) to be distinct in terms of color and shape and tested them through a colorblindness simulator (https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).

Students are also exposed to scientists from diverse backgrounds throughout the lesson (e.g., Slides 21, 97, and 98 of Supporting File S1. Speciation and Conservation – Presentation Slides with Instructor Notes). These scientists differ in terms of age, ethnicity, gender, geographical location, and academic/professional backgrounds. Our goal here is to break down societal barriers to inclusion in science by promoting the message that there are multiple paths to becoming a scientist (51).

Students' socioeconomic diversity was also an important consideration in our lesson design; students are not required to purchase any textbooks or other supplementary materials to successfully participate in the lesson. Moreover, all formative and summative assessment questions that accompany this lesson are derived from the lecture slides and in-class activities.",531,,,,,

Each group works together to choose someone who can share details of their discussion with the whole audience.  If time allows, there are also reflection questions at the end of the discussion that each individual can answer.

Sorry to Eat and Run: A Lesson Plan for Testing Trade-off in Squirrel Behavior Using Giving Up Densities (GUDs),https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2020.30,Lesson,2020,"Ecology, Evolution ","ecology, animal behavior, Animal form and function, Animal nutrition,1 Squirrel-Net",Yes,"This lesson contains a diverse array of inclusive active-learning strategies that help to build classroom community. When participating in these activities, students work collaboratively in small groups (of 3-5 students that they select) on several formative assessments, which provides them with the opportunity to make their voices heard, draw on each other's strengths, and assist each other with data interpretation (47). The small group questions are either discussed as an entire class or asked about in follow up clicker questions (Supporting File S1. Speciation and Conservation – Presentation Slides with Instructor Notes; Supporting File S2. Speciation and Conservation – Discussion After Application Worksheet Activity). Students earn points for participating in the clicker questions and are not scored based on selecting the correct answer. This grading policy supports the message that students should think about the questions and get help when they are incorrect, rather than worry about the grade. More information about using this scoring scheme can be found in a recent review about using clicker questions in biology courses (48). For the summative assessment, we employed a two-stage exam design (49,50) at the end of the semester, where students first answer the questions as individuals, turn in their individual answers, and then work in small randomly-assigned groups to answer the questions again. The group part inspired lively discussions where students explain their thinking and provided each other with immediate feedback.

We also designed the lesson to emphasize diverse perspectives and frame speciation in a way that endeavors to be both relevant and engaging. Before the start of the lesson, students are asked to submit photos of animals that are symbolically significant to their own cultures or identities, which are then incorporated into the lecture slides (Slide 13 of Supporting File S1. Speciation and Conservation – Presentation Slides with Instructor Notes). This assignment has several potential benefits, including that students feel valued in seeing their chosen animal represented on the slide and learn about their peers' backgrounds. To build upon this personal investment, we focused our lesson around the giraffe, which invites strong public engagement from communities and conservationists across the globe.

To be mindful of students who may have a color vision deficiency, we carefully designed the figures in the slides (Supporting File S1. Speciation and Conservation – Presentation Slides with Instructor Notes; Supporting File S2. Speciation and Conservation – Discussion After Application Worksheet Activity) to be distinct in terms of color and shape and tested them through a colorblindness simulator (https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).

Students are also exposed to scientists from diverse backgrounds throughout the lesson (e.g., Slides 21, 97, and 98 of Supporting File S1. Speciation and Conservation – Presentation Slides with Instructor Notes). These scientists differ in terms of age, ethnicity, gender, geographical location, and academic/professional backgrounds. Our goal here is to break down societal barriers to inclusion in science by promoting the message that there are multiple paths to becoming a scientist (51).

Students' socioeconomic diversity was also an important consideration in our lesson design; students are not required to purchase any textbooks or other supplementary materials to successfully participate in the lesson. Moreover, all formative and summative assessment questions that accompany this lesson are derived from the lecture slides and in-class activities. Squirrel-Net modules in general are designed to provide all students in a class with the opportunity to engage in authentic research experiences. Participating in CUREs, like Squirrel-Net, has been shown to have significant impacts on students' sense of self-efficacy as a scientist and may promote retention in science, particularly for students from under-represented groups (20). One unique element of this CURE is the use of the national network, which we believe will further help students feel as though they are making important contributions and belong to a broader scientific community beyond their specific classroom or institution (21).

Depending on how the instructor implements this activity, there are numerous opportunities for active learning techniques such as multiple-hands, multiple-voices, think-pair-share, and whip arounds, each of which provide a less-intimidating opportunity for all students to contribute their voice to the discussion (22). We have also used jigsaw to dissect primary literature articles (e.g., 4-9) related to the activity. This can be done separately in a 50-minute lecture period or a shorter version can be incorporated into the first lab instead of the prompt we recommend in the lesson plan. Finelli et al. (23) provide an excellent lesson on how to use a jigsaw with primary literature.

Using Images of Foraging Leaf-Cutter Ants to Teach Linear Regression,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2020.32,Lesson,2020,"Ecology, Introduction Biology, Science Process Skills","linear regression, experimental design, Plant-insect interactions, Symbiosis, Foraging behavior",Yes,"An accessible “indoor” field experience

This computer-based lesson gives classes/courses who are unable to go into the field because of geographic, budgetary, medical/health, time, or seasonal/weather constraints the opportunity to collect meaningful ecological data.

Emphasis on visuals

Images and videos are powerful tools for engaging student interest. However, the visual nature of the lesson does place unfortunate limitations on the value for students with visual impairments. Many image analysis tasks done manually require careful mouse-work to delineate shapes or lengths on a screen. Thus, as written, the lesson is not well-suited for students with visual impairments.

There are modifications that could improve accessibility and benefit all students by providing other ways of encoding and interpreting visual information. By its nature, image analysis turns visual information into quantitative information - numerical measurements of lengths, areas, color intensities, etc. Providing numerical metrics of visual properties of biological specimens could help students with visual impairments experience specimens (via screen readers, sonification systems, etc.) that would otherwise be unavailable, and may benefit all students by providing multiple ways of representing or encoding the information.

Interestingly, image analysis is often automated to improve speed, accuracy, and repeatability (15). A lesson that focused on image analysis automation could teach valuable real-world skills and open up participation to more students (e.g., students in computer science courses).

Group work

Group work, when managed well by the instructor, can provide an environment where the diverse assets of students yield a better product than any individual student could have created themselves. Facilitating productive collaboration can be challenging, though, and requires active strategies of the instructor. Below are some approaches we have used successfully. We encourage instructors to choose strategies they believe will be effective to ensure equal and active participation among their students (see 16-17 for more ideas).

Gather ideas from all group members

When groups need to pick a research question, some students will be more willing to share initial ideas than others. Give students time to think about and make a list of possible research questions before they form groups. Once they are in groups, ask students to exchange lists and read each other's ideas aloud.

Have students work individually first

Although students work on most of this lab in groups, they complete the regression assignment (Supporting File S9. Leaf-cutter ants – Regression practice sheet) individually. Providing time for students to think through and write out their answers before discussing with group members helps students clarify what they understand and what they have questions about.

Diversify group skillsets

We find that when groups are heterogeneous with regards to Excel proficiency, they tend to troubleshoot technical issues internally instead of waiting for help from the instructor. This is desirable, as it encourages students to help each other and builds community.

Make group members accountable to each other (and to you!)

Two goals of this activity are to help all students become more comfortable creating scatterplots and performing linear regressions. These goals cannot be accomplished if one group member makes the scatterplot or runs the analysis while the other(s) sit passively. Tell students you expect them to actively contribute to every component of the module. For example, if one student is creating a scatterplot, their group members should be reviewing online tutorials or proofreading the graph. One strategy to keep group members accountable is to require students to write and turn in a log of the specific tasks they complete. Group members should review and sign one another's logs before submission. Another strategy is to require students to complete anonymous peer evaluations at the end of each lab.

Student projects can represent a broad range of topics depending on instructor guidelines and curricular needs.

The development and presentation of a comic encourages students to use visual communication rather than rely on words alone to clearly communicate science. Visual communication is an important strategy to engage the bilingual Deaf community in science (19). Visual communication is also useful for students who are English language learners and for students with disabilities.

Additionally, scientific information is often inaccessible due to journal pay walls and unfamiliar scientific jargon. Comics told in everyday language with compelling illustrations make science accessible and relevant to a larger audience.

Using student perceptions and cooperative learning to unpack primary literature on global change,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2020.35,lesson,2020,ecology,"global change, anthropocene, earth-system, planetary boundary concept, thresholds",Yes,"Students who complete this lesson explicitly hold different perceptions of how human activity has changed various earth system processes and the degree to which humans can safely alter these processes without crossing biophysical thresholds. Such perceptions would be difficult to draw out particularly in a large-enrollment course without purposeful opportunities to promote students' sense of belonging and self-efficacy (14,15). In this lesson, these perceptions are illustrated in the first component of the assignment and used to determine three planetary boundaries that groups summarize in class. This activity thereby encourages students both to consider how others' perceptions might differ in regards to a given planetary boundary and the degree to which others' perceptions and their own align with our current scientific understanding.

The class sessions in which this lesson takes place, are designed to promote participation of all students in several ways. First, a student response system (Kahoot!) was used to ask where students placed the safe operating space for humanity prior to reading the paper (Supporting File S2. Perceptions and Cooperative Learning – Reading Assurance Assignment and In-Class Polling Questions). Students answered this question using personal accounts that were established at the beginning of the semester to facilitate in-class participation during all class sessions. Responses are then made visible to the entire class and used to frame instructions for the in-class group assignment. This question is used to give instructors a sense of the variability in responses that students will be discussing and serves as a transition between a short introductory lecture and the collaborative group activity. The instructor and teaching assistants circulate among the groups to ensure that discussion time is equally shared. Timing prompts can also be given to ensure each member of the group has an equal time to share their predictions prior to compiling group results and discussing the paper. In addition, we recommend that the instructor require each group to appoint a student to be a discussion moderator to ensure equal participation of all group members; this is particularly critical in large-enrollment courses in which instructor access to each group is limited by seat arrangement. To complete guided discussion questions (Supporting File S5. Perceptions and Cooperative Learning – Discussion and Assessment Questions), we suggest first having students perform a Think-Pair-Share and then reconvene as a 4-member group to develop answers to each question. The instructor can then call on groups randomly and/or call on specific groups that arrive at particular answers to each question for the full class discussion. Having students complete both formative assessments through use of the guided discussion questions and summative assessments (Supporting File S5. Perceptions and Cooperative Learning – Discussion and Assessment Questions) encourages students to engage with their peers and the material both in and out of class.

The activity utilizes all five forms of representations as described by Gilbert (1): concrete, verbal, symbolic, visual, and gestures: (1) The three-dimensional manipulative model of the Holliday junction is concrete; (2) multiple opportunities are provided for students to describe what the model and what is happening at every step of Holliday junction resolution; (3) symbolic molecular representations are interpreted when students compare the manipulative to crystal structure models of DNA; (4) multiple visual representations, including crystal structure images, schematics, and the three-dimensional manipulative, provide a variety of visual approaches to the same system; (5) students use a variety of gestures to physically manipulate the three-dimensional model to create the different structures that exist in the Holliday junction.

This activity will leverage diversity within the classroom by encouraging every student to provide their perspective on how the molecules are structured and how they are changing. In particular, the color-coded chenille stems that are described here are highly adaptable for differently-abled students, including varying color combinations for dichromats and trichromats, or using differently-textured stems for visually-impaired students. These activities have been successfully integrated with professional online animations that are expertly narrated, and multiple problem sets allow study and practice at multiple learning paces.

The cooperative nature inherent in the small group format may increase student engagement, leading to an increase in learning gains (4). Further, because the activities rely on a visual-spatial element (drawing), students may see an increase in information recall compared to more conventional methods (5). Throughout the lesson, students are tasked with drawing (a concrete experience) as well as interpreting and assessing scientific data. In our course, as in most A&P courses at this level, some of the content introduced by the activity (e.g., the pharmacology) is novel to students. This should place students on equal footing at the beginning of the activity, and prevent prior knowledge from life or academic experience from giving certain students an advantage over their peers. Moreover, the reflective questions included in the case study have students look at ethnic variations in ulcer susceptibility, as well as the intersection of health and socioeconomic status (e.g., an ulcer patient without health insurance might rely more on less efficacious over-the-counter treatments like antacids, whereas someone with health insurance would presumably have access to proton pump inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and antibiotics).

Alongside of that, inputs from other students that had consumed products made from teff, chia, and quinoa were woven into the discussion as well. While surveying discussions taking place around the classroom, we noticed parallel themes from other crops (e.g., kale, avocado, and maize) emerging in conversation as well.

In terms of instructor practices, involvement of a broader group of individuals was encouraged. During breakout group discussions, the instructor and the teaching assistant served both to stimulate discussion of quieter groups and to motivate involvement of more students in the breakout discussions.

The actors can, of course, participate both cognitively and physically, but the involvement of their support group can lessen performance anxiety. Visually and hearing-impaired students can fully participate in this activity, which uses noises generated by percussion instruments to represent output. All students will benefit by ensuring that the performers exaggerate the movements used to create the noises and are clearly visible. Moreover, support groups should be encouraged to provide their advice in an auditory, as well as visual, fashion.

This lesson captures the diversity of biological sex by including data from males and females. This lesson also invokes a number of multiple intelligences (69) among a cohort of diverse learners. This lab specifically appeals to students' visual-spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, logical-mathematic, verbal-linguistic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal abilities. For students, such capabilities expressed in the lab can extend beyond the scope of the course and into real-world interactions. The hybrid nature of this lab also appeals to differing student mindsets. This laboratory module is a hybrid virtual module in the sense that it incorporates the use of a virtual dissector table as well as traditional laboratory exercises. In addition, this module embraces the essence of hybrid learning because students can access its pre-lab reading material online via email or an instructional online learning management (OLM) interface such as Canvas or Blackboard. This pre-lab reading assignment also contains embedded YouTube and Khan Academy videos that allow the students to explore web-based, digital content in addition to electronic text.

As the promotion of diversity and inclusion within many institutions in the United States has become increasingly paramount, many organizations and social entities are encouraged to adopt standards or policies that celebrate the diversity of their members while also fostering inclusive environments in which all members feel like part of a cohesive team. Such diversity and inclusion standards can be established for professional societies, degree programs, and even anatomy and physiology classes (70). For example, in this particular module, instructors have the opportunity to discuss occupational diversity (70) in the context of an anatomy and physiology course. Students in the course will ultimately decide to pursue different occupations/career paths which in turn can influence the level of interest a student may have in a particular topic covered in the course. The interested students can then help to motivate other students based on their enthusiasm and excitement for the topic. This module should particularly appeal to those students interested in occupational therapy, physical therapy, or exercise science since many of the concepts regarding kinesiology and biomechanics are highly relevant to these fields. Instructors could offer at the beginning of the lesson a quick explanation of why the lab module concepts are pertinent to these particular students and/or fields of study. Even if there are no students in the course who intend to become occupational or physical therapists, instructors can discuss how the content pertaining to skeletal muscle anatomy would also be revisited in greater detail in medical, dental, nurse anesthesia, physician assistant, or other anatomy-relevant curricula. Moreover, exposure to this content and its career correlations may allow students an opportunity to consider such relevant fields as professional options. Such exposure is especially important for under-represented populations including women, trans or gender non-conforming, or other underrepresented minority students since it might encourage these individuals to help diversify fields in which there is a paucity of members of their respective groups. For instance, physical therapy is a field often predominated by Caucasian men while occupational therapy is a field often predominated by Caucasian women; exposure to fields other than the stereotypical norms can help educate underrepresented students about a more diverse array of options to help them make the best decisions for themselves. On the other hand, some students might not intend to pursue any health-related careers. Nevertheless, instructors could discuss the relevancy of the concepts such as metabolism, homeostasis, maximal oxygen consumption, and anaerobic capacity to an understanding of basic health during physical exercise.

Since students are engaged in physical exercises during the lab module, instructors have the opportunity to emphasize the importance of physical exercise, in general, in people's daily lives. For instructors teaching in states that have higher healthcare disparities than normal, providing statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) regarding the state of health of their citizens (71) can be a powerful learning experience for providing awareness to students. (International readers can refer to their respective health institutions for similar data.) Such awareness can motivate students then to be advocates for healthier lifestyles among their colleagues, friends, families, and community members. This advocacy is also important even in states or regions that are predominated by healthy individuals because there may be some subsets of the population which lack healthy lifestyles due to a number of factors that can include limited access to healthy foods, lower socioeconomic status, reduced health literacy, or other social determinants of health (72,73). By creating an atmosphere of comradery around physical activity as a critical strategy for reducing health disparities and supporting healthy living (74,75), instructors can invite students into a learning community that is inclusive while also diverse. For example, instructors can support an atmosphere of comradery in this lab module by allowing the groups to challenge one another to see which group is the fittest. Alternatively, instructors could display on the walls posters that convey helpful tips for students to incorporate at least thirty minutes of exercise (e.g., walking, jogging, biking, etc.) into their daily routines and could provide encouraging and motivating words to stay healthy. Additionally, instructors could provide opportunities for students to create groups to support healthy lifestyles and hang photos of individuals of diverse backgrounds engaged in physical activities. Instructors can also provide encouraging words and highlight helpful tips during the exercise physiology component of the lab.

Instructors might also teach classes of anatomy and physiology in which students might have disabilities or injuries that prevent them from engaging in the exercise physiology lab activities. Students with disabilities provide another enriching opportunity for incorporating experiential diversity (70,76,77) into the class and creating a more inclusive environment. Instructors can make a number of decisions to accommodate students with disabilities or injuries. Instructors can simply allow such students to abstain from physical activity and work in close proximity with a partner within their lab group or perhaps even serve as the scribe for their lab group if they are able. If the students have the ability to perform alternative exercises (e.g., manually propelling their wheelchairs with their arms), instructors could also provide such students with the option of engaging in the lab activities under modified circumstances. Either way, instructors would consider the freedom of choice and the comfort of the students in this decision. Students who chose to abstain could be placed into a think-pair-share group with their assigned partner within their lab group. In a think-pair-share sequence, the students would have an opportunity to think or write about and discuss the biological concepts being explored in the lab activities (78,79). For instance, in this lab module, if there are students using wheelchairs, crutches, or some other assistive device for mobility, these students can be prompted to explain to their lab group partners how the same concepts of exhaustion and muscle fatigue can apply to situations in which they are rapidly rotating the wheels of their chair or moving their crutches with their arms, perhaps to rush somewhere quickly. In the communication exchange, students without disabilities could gain insights into the experiences of someone who cannot perform tasks that involve physical exertion, like pedaling on the stationary bicycle during the Wingate Test or running on the treadmill during the maximal oxygen consumption experiment, while also sharing their experiences as they perform the Wingate Test and running experiments. In this example, the students with disabilities are provided an equitable opportunity to engage in the lab activities by alternative means since they cannot perform the experiments in the same way that other students can, but they are also included in the conversation and learning experiences with the other students.

Instructors might even choose to adopt a think-pair-share policy for all students in the class to promote further inclusion and equity (79). Dr. Kimberly D. Tanner also provides a self-assessment of equitable teaching strategies in her article on promoting student engagement and cultivating classroom equity (79), so instructors might want to consult this tool when evaluating the inclusive nature of their own classroom. While this article addresses classroom teaching practices as a whole, many of these strategies can be incorporated into this lab module in addition to the think-pair-share technique. Because the students will already be actively participating in groups, instructors might consider ambulating the room and attending to each group periodically to ensure that all students are participating either in the activities or in discussion concerning the activities and that all students are provided fair access to learning, thinking, and teaching.

Many approaches were implemented to make the course more personal, structured, and engaging, in line with recommendations for building an inclusive environment suitable for all learners (21).

The design and delivery of curricular materials was based on evidence about student reasoning, and the impact of diverse backgrounds and prior experiences on learning. All classes incorporated collaborative group work conducted in small, permanent groups (3-4 students). The groups were engineered to be diverse in terms of students' prior coursework, majors, and demographic variables. Diverse groups were generated using the ""create_groups"" function in the R package 'minDiff' v. 0.01-3 (22). This function assigns students to N groups by minimizing (via 10,000 repetitions) the differences among groups for one or multiple criteria (e.g., prior biology courses, plan, demographic variables). The result is a set of group assignments in which students are heterogenous within groups and homogeneous among groups.

Each group was assigned to work with a UGTA who was responsible for formally documenting group progress and trying to understand thinking in order to foster learning. Each UGTA oversaw a maximum of 35 students. UGTAs were responsible for knowing students' names and seating locations and were able to identify when groups were in need of assistance. UGTAs were utilized to help the instructor gauge student engagement and identify topics that were difficult for students. UGTAs wore name tags and students were provided with name tents. The instructor made efforts to call students by their names in every class, both during small group conversations and during class-wide discussions. The instructor also used transparent and low-stakes ""cold calling"" to encourage engagement during activities and to foster the contribution of diverse student voices.

To appropriately prepare UGTAs for their important roles, they participated in 4.5 hours of workshops throughout the semester (focusing on cognition, engagement, and diversity) that sought to encourage inclusive teaching practices and a growth mindset. UGTAs were also prepared weekly with information about the upcoming activities, content, and learning difficulties they could expect to encounter.

Some campuses are able to provide such equipment to students and instructors alike given the need for virtual learning and teaching. As it possible that not everyone has a dedicated and private workspace, the instructor should reassure the class that they do not need to use video, but instead can rely or audio or even just typing in a chat box.

I would recommend that students form their own discussion groups, just as they would if the experiment was conducted in person. This will provide a sense of familiarity and comfort, which is likely to be appreciated given the fact that the experiment is being carried out virtually.

In addition, when designing videos for the pre-lab lectures, the instructor should keep in mind that they should provide notes, audio, as well as video to accommodate students with disabilities. I also recommend following up individually with students to ensure that the material has been presented suitably.

Lastly, the instructor needs to make sure that the individualized feedback that the students receive on both of the formative assessments is thoughtful, constructive, and well-explained. Because the students do not have traditional face-to-face time, they will rely on this feedback to prepare their lab reports. In addition, the instructor should be open to suggestions or modifications from the students given the unconventional way of completing this experiment.

Through sharing their own experiences, students are exposed to the different perspectives of their peers, thus validating diverse perspectives and supporting contributions from other students. The use of LTM supports the development of metacognitive skills, particularly monitoring one's own learning. Aspects of identity, including being aware of ways in which learning and identity intersect, can be included in classroom discussions around the LTMs, especially if the assignment is expanded to include extracurricular activities (in addition to courses) or if a Longitudinal Transfer Map is done, which would include past learning as well as projected future learning needs.

By acting as enzymes, it incorporates a physical connection to the material, which engages students through additional routes. Some of the work is done in small groups with several roles (enzyme, scientist, recorder, etc.), allowing students to participate at their level of comfort or ability. Moreover, in these groups, students can ask questions of each other or the instructor. The whole class works together to determine the candy saturation curve, which again allows students to participate at the level of their comfort and ability. For students who are not mobile, part of the demonstration is measuring the rate of unwrapping in the absence of having to find and bind the candy, thus allowing contributions from those who cannot, or do not want to, run around the class space. The homework data fitting assignment can be completed individually or as a group assignment and outside resources can be consulted if they are appropriately cited and follow the institutional Honor Code.",188,,,,,

Improving student confidence and ability to interpret data is a primary goal of the RAILS activities. It has been shown that both group-based problem solving and increased transparency have an outsized, positive impact on underserved students' academic performance, confidence, and sense of belonging (17). Studies have shown that diverse groups (i.e. across racial, gender, area of study, class year lines) are more productive than homogenous groups (22). We recommend that instructors group students to maximize diversity within the groups, using demographic information or surveys as sources of information. The instructor should move through the classroom and guide students as issues arise and encourage group collaboration. In an effort to increase the transparency of the RAILS activities, we have elected to incorporate some of the recommendations of (Transparency in Teaching and Learning) TILT Higher Ed (17). For each activity, we have provided both a) the purpose, and b) skills and knowledge gained. Additionally, some difficult, open-ended questions have been clarified by adding language that describes successful answers. We strongly recommend that in introducing the activity, the instructor highlights the purpose statement and learning objectives, with the goal of bringing them to the attention of the students. By doing so, students who might not otherwise understand instructor expectations as a result of an opportunity gap will be more equipped to meet the desired learning outcomes.",239,,,,,

Students classify data individually at home and in lab, engage in small groups to develop projects and learn from one another, and participate in class activities and discussions.
Students learn from both their instructor and peers. They are additionally encouraged to seek additional information online.
Students access information in multiple ways, including instructor delivery, reading, and watching videos.
Students engage in all roles of a scientist, from collecting and classifying image data to analyzing and interpreting processed data.
Students share their knowledge and ideas through a variety of media, including oral presentation, written reflections, graphs, and essays. Students are able to choose the graphical representation of the data that makes the most sense to them.
The system itself (African vertebrate fauna) and medium of data presentation (photographs) are charismatic and engaging to students, encouraging participation and excitement.
The lesson provides an opportunity for students with disabilities that may limit them from participating in physical field work or lab activities to engage in real ecological research using only a computer.
This lesson broadens participation in STEM by providing students that may not have the financial resources to gain biology field experience (e.g., could not afford the costs of travel, field equipment/clothing, or similar) the opportunity to engage in real ecological research using only a computer.

With this in mind, we ask students to prioritize care over speed: rather than quickly scoring the requested number of flies, we prefer that they score fewer than requested and use the relaxed pace to better recognize the phenotypes and understand the cross genetics. (If you are concerned about insufficient sampling, you could supplement your class data with Supporting File S8. Mapping a Mutation – Sample Final Dataset) During the Week 1 and 3 Procedures (Supporting File S2. Mapping a Mutation – Fly Lab Manual), we encourage students to discuss anomalous/interesting observations rather than just assume that they are ""wrong"" and change their individual data to match group consensus.
Encouraging student initiative: We allot class-time during Week 1 for students to work ahead on the Week 3 Pre-laboratory Assignment, asking questions as needed. Similarly, if time is available the week before the Week 1 class, instructors may wish to allot time for students to work ahead on the Week 1 Pre-laboratory Assignment.
Welcoming a diversity of working styles: During our ""study hall"" style office hours between Weeks 4 and 5 (Table 1), we make every effort to accommodate different working styles: we reserve a large room with wireless access and chair arrangements that allow for small group or solitary work, we encourage students to collaborate if they wish, and they may work nearby if they prefer a quieter/less-crowded location. At least one instructor and one TA are available for questions throughout all study halls. If students cannot or would rather not attend these study halls, we are happy to meet with them at another time.
Welcoming a diversity of thinking and writing styles: We give students explicit guidance for how to organize their Final Assignments. However, to help increase their engagement in data analysis, we ask students to prioritize content and a clear narrative over strict form (Supporting File S2. Mapping a Mutation – Fly Lab Manual, Guidelines for Final Assignment section). For example, we give them the option of writing the Results and Discussion separately or combined, since both forms are used in journal articles.
Clear guidance while encouraging creative thinking: Finally, we encourage creative thinking as students design follow-up experiments in their Final Assignments (Supporting File S2. Mapping a Mutation – Fly Lab Manual, Guidelines for Final Assignment section; Supporting File S4. Mapping a Mutation – Grading Keys). Although we provide a clear template for mapping an unknown mutation to a gene, we welcome creative use of FlyBase and GBrowse to gather supporting evidence (Supporting File S2.

In the lab, specifically, we follow the inclusive-by-design approach as opposed to being inclusive-on-request (37). There are four (4) lab stations in the biology and chemistry labs that are specifically designed to accommodate those with physical disabilities as well as processes for chemical, equipment, and waste handling that allow students to participate in all aspects of the experiment.

With respect to fostering an environment that promotes productivity and elevates the learning experience for all students, we have diversified the materials and models used to deliver protocols and assessments of student work. Specifically, we provide all lab protocols in advance so that students can interpret and paraphrase the methods in a way that is most accessible for their learning. In each discipline, students work in self-formed groups. However, during the formation of the larger combined groups, faculty are intentional, making certain that each group is representative of the school’s population as a whole. In doing so, the final groups have a mix of students from different majors, years, demographic backgrounds, and sexes.

With regards to assessment, we have students produce both written and oral presentations, which allows students to demonstrate their learning in more than one format. Support for the production of the final video is available in the form of lab access, faculty access, sample work, and detailed guidelines. At all points during the lab series, students are encouraged to interact with one another and with faculty to ensure their educational needs are being met.

We use think-pair-share to include students who are not comfortable with classroom-wide participation. Think-pair-share is a collaborative learning technique that encourages students to think independently about a question (think), discuss their ideas with a partner (pair), and share their responses with a larger group, such as the whole class. This technique encourages participation as students become more comfortable with participating in whole class discussion after gaining confidence by first sharing their thoughts with a partner (23). We use a jigsaw in this lesson because it encourages inclusiveness and student equity (24). A jigsaw is a teaching strategy that breaks down the class into groups and assigns each group a piece of a puzzle that that the groups assemble to complete the jigsaw together. Finally, we use random call, or an unbiased selection of a student to answer questions, to equalize classroom participation (20) and ensure that all students are attentive and participating in class. Successful completion of the activity requires that each individual participates in the exercise. We acknowledge that some students do not thrive in a group setting, but they can still engage in the activity by writing their thoughts and ideas on worksheets that are collected and evaluated.",219,,,,,
Investigating Cell Signaling with Gene Expression Datasets,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2019.1,Lesson,2019,"Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cell Biologt","genomics, transcription, signaling",Yes,"The Lesson engages students in experimentation with software, thinking activities that require the integration of disparate pieces of information, experimentation, and reflection. In their totality, these activities engage students with differing learning preferences. In our experience, students are proficient in finding information on the Web; however, in many cases they require training in identifying the most salient points, and in writing and paraphrasing scientific content. The process of gathering information and re-writing is fundamental to internalization and care should be taken in the selection of materials to ensure the appropriate level of difficulty since students may not be able to meaningfully write if the material is too complex. Depending on the pathway selected, examples should be drawn from students' lived experiences. This promotes connection with the subject matter. Assigned readings from the relevant sections of the textbook provide the baseline knowledge for further exploration. Another excellent source for foundational knowledge in cell biology in general and cell signaling in particular is Scitable (https://www.nature.com/scitable).

Through manipulation of the pathways and in a group setting, students explore important scientific concepts that touch on gene structure and function. The opportunity to cooperate with peers and to meaningfully contribute to the groups accomplishments builds confidence and work ethic. Given the availability of audiovisual media resources in this area, such as videos and educational articles from authoritative websites (for example, https://www.ibiology.org/biology-videos/, https://www.nature.com/scitable, and https://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/about-biointeractive), students can be engaged through different methods that make learning interactive and appealing to students with different learning styles. Also, these materials allow students who start at different levels of understanding the opportunity to attain the desired level of mastery if they are willing to put in the effort. The links for learning materials of different levels of complexity are posted on the Learning Management System (LMS), which allows students the opportunity select different starting points based on background knowledge. The instructor describes these materials to give the students a general understanding of the different levels of difficulty. Based on this, advanced students can progress to research articles quickly whereas other students would spend more time on the videos and introductory websites before progressing to research articles.

Overall, the Lesson engages students in hands-on activities, incorporates student led discussions, and draws on student-lived experiences. Through this approach students learn the required content and gain computational skills from the instructor and through cooperation with their peers.

Instructors make a point to ask for student feedback throughout the lesson and to interact individually with each student to ensure that each student feels valued and understands that their contribution is important. Additionally, authentic research experiences in classrooms have been shown to be more inclusive than regular, individually selected research positions, allowing diverse students to gain research experience (20), making this lesson extremely inclusive.",129,,,,,

As groups of students work through this activity, they create a physical model that becomes the shared mental model for how PCR works. Because the modeling activity is administered to small groups and requires three rounds of ""PCR"" (template denaturation, primer annealing and synthesis), it encourages all students to get involved and contribute to the activity. The nature of the foam pieces (i.e., all the same shape, but different colors) encourages students to work together to identify primer binding sites and hunt for the next complementary nucleotide during extension. All students in the group, regardless of experience level or English Language status, will have something to point to, pick up and manipulate which allows for non-verbal communication to occur during the activity.",140,,,,,

The instructor may assign pairs and pairs-of-pairs to facilitate interaction with peers with diverse views and approaches to learning. The instructor can create heterogeneous groups by drawing on differences in student academic performance in the class, discipline, or differences in writing and/or organizational skills. Peer-to-peer teaching may also be effective in instructor-assigned groups in which students have heterogeneous levels of familiarity with bioinformatics tools and databases. The materials are accessible by complying with universal design principles (33,34). Information is presented in different ways including paper models, computational algorithms, teacher demonstrations, and peer-to-peer interaction. Students can express their level of understanding through verbal interactions with the instructor, individual exploration and reflection, group discussion and reflection, and individual summative assessment.

Even though students self-select to form teams, we have found based on our observations that most teams typically consist of diverse expertise. Team members are strongly encouraged to rotate tasks, so that everyone can experience and learn the different tasks within the lesson. In our experience, we find that when students form their own teams, they are comfortable working with one another, consistent with research showing that self-selected teams have better communication, are more enthusiastic about working together, take interest in one another, feel more confident in the other teammates' abilities, and are more productive and equitable (16).",148,,,,,

First, as the gateway introductory biology course required for all biology majors and some other programs, all our biology students have equal access to an authentic research experience early in their academic career. Second, the term-long barcoding project is centered on exploring the natural diversity of the JMU Arboretum. These sorts of natural habitats can often be unfamiliar to students, so we make great efforts to make them accessible to all students regardless of their familiarity or comfort with nature. Thus, these labs provide an opportunity for all students to learn about the organisms and habitats in their own proverbial backyard. Furthermore, students are free to select the organism they investigate, which supports student comfort, creative autonomy, and project ownership. Likewise, the data students generate are added to an open-access species database that other researchers, arboretum staff, and the general public can use for research, outreach, learning natural history, or conservation purposes. Open access to these student-generated data not only enhances the inclusivity of these labs, but also has the potential to increase the meaningfulness of these labs for both students and non-student users. For example, data generated by students at JMU have been used in faculty research to identify unique or hard to identify species of beetles and beetle larvae. Students have also contributed data for fungal surveys conducted by the Mycological Society of America. Furthermore, students are free to select an organism of interest to investigate, which supports creative autonomy and project ownership. Third, as referenced above as a design framework feature, the field and lab activities are collaborative and require effective teamwork inside and outside of the classroom for the successful completion of tasks. Fourth, varying modalities of instruction incorporated into the lessons such as hands-on tasks, online modules, mini-lectures, discussions, and demonstrations, accommodate student preferences in learning. Similarly, as described above, varying forms of formative and summative assessments are used to measure student learning trajectories and guide instruction. As possible, assignments are criterion-scored using standardized rubrics made available in advance to make student expectations explicit (e.g. Supporting File S6.5: Week 06 - Biodiversity Lab Report - Guidelines, Rubric, and Template.docx, but see lesson plan descriptions below for detailed supporting files). Lastly, in that the lab activities are situated in three differing areas of study, ecology, molecular biology, bioinformatics, it helps speak to students with varying interests or proclivities.",407,,,,,

What do Bone and Silly Putty® have in Common?: A Lesson on Bone Viscoelasticity,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2019.12,Lesson,2019,Anatomy-Physiology,"structure-function, injury, Anisotropy, Hysteresis, Skeletal System, Viscoelasticity",Yes,"This lesson includes several visual elements, focusing primarily on a graphical analysis of the projected stress-strain curve and on the real-time manipulation of Silly Putty®. This manipulation also incorporates a kinesthetic aspect to the lesson, especially for those students who have the chance to handle the putty. Thus, this lesson may better attract the attention of students who preferentially approach learning through visual-spatial or bodily-kinesthetic means (4), as opposed to primarily through the more-traditional verbal-linguistic or logical-mathematical means.

This real-world experiential demonstration may also appeal more to students who might be located within the ""converger"" realm of David Kolb's learning styles, as laid out in his 1984 treatise on experiential learning (5). Such students fall closer to the ""active experimentation"" end on the processing dimension and the ""abstract conceptualization"" end on the perception dimension (5), giving them some of the qualities associated with engineers, whose work involves iterative modes of thinking conceptually and then instantiating and executing ideas in the real world to see if their ideas work in practice. Those students who do have the opportunity actually to handle the Silly Putty® material may be able to approach the lesson from the learning perspectives of either a ""Pragmatist""--putting abstract concepts into real-world practice--and/or a ""Reflector""--observing and then subsequently thinking about activities (6).

Though the students themselves, in a large lecture classroom, cannot all have the concrete tactile experience of directly handling the Silly Putty®, they are all in fact able to watch it being handled. Such observation can engage the mirror neuron system, which is thought to be essential for learning by imitation (for a review of this system, see Reference 7). Thus, the demonstration has the potential for also possibly tapping into other sensory modalities (e.g., touch), or cortically-mirrored motor planning to enrich the student experience of the lesson.

While the practice of specifically modifying teaching methodologies to match preferred student learning styles has come under recent scrutiny and skepticism (8,9), engaging students of different academic backgrounds and life experiences remains nevertheless as important as it is challenging, particularly when discussing dense material such as this. Therefore, framing the lesson within the context of athletics, and using familiar objects, can render the lesson less intimidating and make the content more universally accessible. We designed this activity so it may facilitate meaningful connections for the students, perhaps even including personal ones. Building such connections may result in improvements to the affective domain (10) of students' relationships to and perceptions or understanding of the coursework. Reciprocally, improvements in the affective domain have the potential to positively impact students' attitudes towards and personal attachment to STEM material. Being able to draw links between the course material and everyday-life applications helps students--especially from underrepresented minority groups--develop a greater sense of belonging in STEM fields (11), and thus enhances their experience in the classroom and the course, which may additionally have the beneficial effect of aiding in student retention.

We further fostered inclusivity by using this activity as an alternative assessment (in contrast to high-stakes multiple choice or short answer exams) and incorporated multiple ways for students to demonstrate their understanding (e.g. written summary, group discussion). Our activity also requires students to use authentic data to answer authentic questions, and as such is a form of authentic assessment.

Students work in groups to solve problems that are applied to different contexts. Students are encouraged to articulate their thoughts to one another as they move through the questions assigned. A random number generator can be used to call on one of the groups to share their answer, but each group can designate a 'reporter' so those who are shy are not forced to speak in front of a large classroom. Alternatively, the group reporter can be designated by the instructor who assigns it by asking the group: who woke up earliest that morning, has a birthday coming up, or whose name starts with a letter closest to the letter 'Z' (8). These random assignments may reduce public speaking anxiety and help reduce gender bias in participation (7).

Since genetic drift is based on probability, there is a chance that results of the simulations will not be as expected (e.g., no groups will reach fixation, or all groups will reach fixation for the same bean color), which provides an opportunity for students to explore what happens in science when predictions are not met. As an addition to the end of the class activity, the instructor may ask students to generate their own activity or method for simulating genetic drift.",141,,,,,
Using Structured Decision Making to Explore Complex Environmental Issues,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2019.18,Lesson,2019,Ecology,"interdisciplinary, socio-ecological systems, science policy, stakeholder, structured decision making",Yes,"Participants in structured decision making scenarios explicitly hold different viewpoints about an environmental topic. Therefore, this activity encourages students both to consider how others’ objectives and values might differ in regards to an environmental issue and how considering others’ viewpoints might influence their own views. Depending on how the instructor interacts with students during this lesson, this lesson can empower students to be stakeholders and citizens who can contribute to decision making about environmental problems (10). Additionally, structured decision making as a tool aims to make policy-making more transparent and integrates multiple academic disciplines with stakeholder interests.

In the Amazon hydroelectric development example provided in this lesson, students are encouraged to think about an environmental issue that affects a part of the world that may be socially and culturally distinct from their own experience. Likewise, you could select other environmental topics that are located in different cultures from those with which your students may be familiar.

This lesson is designed to ensure participation of all students in several ways. First, the instructor and any co-instructors or teaching assistants circulate among the groups to ensure that discussion time is equally shared. Second, the instructor can give timing prompts to give each member of the group an equal time to share their opinions. In addition, we recommend that the instructor assign a student in each group to be a discussion moderator to ensure equal participation of all students in the discussion.  Finally, the mixed assessment method, using both formative and summative assessments, allows students to engage with the material in a variety of ways.

As student-scientists, they are required to prepare rationales and protocols (in the form of introduction, procedures, and expected results) ahead of individual experiments, giving time and framework to assemble their own questions and answers to problems. This strategy encourages active participation by students who are less likely to participate in discussion (24). The lesson and its structure also gives students the freedom to make decisions (and mistakes) regarding the process with minimal judgement or interference from instructor. Students are instead encouraged to utilize peer groups to validate or defend their own ideas. This provides a cooperative learning experience where the outcome of peer-discussions will determine students' performance in the lab (25). Weekly feedback on individual writing assignments provides another opportunity for inclusive teaching (24), but also can be used, along with formative assessments, to correct any misconceptions stemming from misguided student-led learning.",183,,,,,
A Short Laboratory Module to Help Infuse Metacognition during an Introductory Course-based Research Experience,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2019.20,Lesson,2019,Science Process Skills,"metacognition, gene expression, Scientific Process, Experimenal Design, Hypothesis Generation, model organisms",Yes,"The demographics of students enrolled in WWU's Introductory Cell and Molecular Biology course from Spring 2015-Winter 2018 included: 30% first-generation college students (defined as having two parents who did not complete college), 71% low-income FAFSA applicants, and 16.4% students who identify as belonging to a traditionally underserved racial minority group (Hispanic/Latinx, African American/Black, Native American/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, or Filipino/Hmong/Vietnamese). It is known that many students, especially those from the groups listed above, leave science not because they lack the potential to succeed, but because they do not identify with those in the scientific community or view themselves as capable of success as scientists (12,20). By infusing explicit practice with metacognition in the context of a research module, we aim to have all of our students become aware of their engagement as legitimate scientists with diverse experiences and points of view.

To increase the sense that a scientist identity is achievable by our students, we explicitly connect metacognitive processes that are critical for science (listed in Table 1) to the laboratory and metacognitive module activities that the students engage in. Moreover, the opportunity to engage in a true scientific struggle allows students to reframe difficult moments in science as a natural part of doing real science rather than a referendum on their own potential as scientists, potentially increasing student development of a growth mindset towards science. In our implementation of this module as a Tetrahymena-focused research project, we were also able to introduce relevant preliminary data that had been obtained by another undergraduate student researcher (21). In sum, students can make the connection that research can be difficult, that previous research can be improved upon, and that they can be the ones to improve upon it.

The structure of this module requires the equal participation of all students, with evidence of their involvement collected in the form of various assessments, including worksheets and participation in class discussions. Students are given time to process concepts and organize their own thoughts through take-home work or in small-group explorations before being asked to report out to the class or to complete hands-on laboratory activities. This provides students with the opportunity to fully participate in and bolster their confidence for in-class work. The metacognitive prompts and assigned homework are designed to be inclusive of diverse points of view, allowing for a variety of possible answers (see Supporting Files S8-S10). Finally, we emphasize the importance and strength of a diverse community to making scientific progress in our module. Student pairs must draw on each other's strengths to accomplish several distinct tasks, from collecting information in silico to execution of laboratory protocols to reflecting on their experiences and decision-making.",443,,,,,

Additionally, the familiarity provides a personal relevance that has been shown to improve learning irrespective of student background (8). However, not all students may be familiar with these games, particularly international students. These games tend to be easy to learn and working in teams can accelerate the learning process. Teams are also useful for helping instructors maximize diversity by populating the teams with students from different backgrounds.

In addition to the diversity of fields of study and academic level, students vary in age, race, national background and possibly other characteristics that may not be visible to the instructor.

The activity involves individual and group tasks. Small group tasks are considered cooperative learning techniques and have been described as active learning exercises that foster student learning (20).

For these learning experiences to be successful, it is not required that students have prerequisite knowledge. All required information is given during instruction in lecture and/or laboratory; therefore, it encourages participation of all students regardless of baseline knowledge. Instruction employs handouts, PowerPoint slides and oral instruction, serving the diversity of learning needs in the classroom. As students work in groups in the lab and lecture, they can discuss the experimental protocol and results with their group members to aid in their understanding. We allowed self-selection of groups, but instructors can assign groups to increase diversity in each group and further promote inclusion.

Another way to improve group work and promote inclusion is to provide instruction on effective group work practices at the beginning of the project. This is especially important if you plan to assign a group presentation, poster, or writing assignment related to this project. We have developed a class session on effective group work and planning that can be used with these modules (Supporting File S5: Working in Groups - Lecture Slides). Finally, time is provided during lab classes to complete much of the group work related to this project (e.g., planning, data analysis), in order to be inclusive for students with obligations outside of class, such as work or family commitments.

There is diversity in the prevalence of the different ACTN3 genotypes throughout various populations, genders, and races (10,12-15), and students should observe this diversity when they conduct their literature reviews. Students are able to work collaboratively in their groups to conduct literature searches. Furthermore, classroom collaboration occurs during the development of the synthesis matrix and the overall project, when students have the opportunity to demonstrate their diversity of opinions and engage in productive discussions that ultimately result in the best experimental design.

Lastly, the phenotypic modules, which involve measurement of muscle phenotypes in each student, are applicable to individuals of varying physical capabilities, but are also made voluntary. On average, biological males have higher muscle mass than biological females, and it is therefore important to stratify results by biological sex during analysis of data. In order to account for transgender, non-binary, or other individuals who are uncomfortable disclosing biological sex, an option to not disclose biological sex is included on the demographic information form (Supporting File S10: Demographic Information Form). Collate this information in a manner that keeps it private. While participation in the physical activity and disclosure of biological sex is voluntary, analysis of anonymous results and data is required. We have found that the majority of students opt to participate in the experiments and disclose biological sex.

All students are challenged with different approaches to learning. Furthermore, it is a group activity in which at least 2-3 students are expected to work together, facilitating contributions from diverse perspectives that can be enlightening, refreshing, and inspiring. Although we typically allow students to self-select into groups, in our experience, individuals in such lab groups tend to take on unique roles that are in line with their diverse academic strengths and personalities. For example, one student may have solid skills working with data and numbers but lack experience with live subjects. Another might learn better by hands-on activities and already have some good experience in field biology. This would be a naturally successful pair.

The extent of variation between individuals is only just being appreciated. Exercise resistance, for example, is a new field of research, which looks at individuals who may be predisposed genetically or epigenetically to have a weak or absent metabolic response to exercise (24). There are only a handful of genes that are predicted to influence exercise response, and although these have been identified in some studies, follow up research has had limited success in verifying their roles (35), likely underscoring the variability in this system and the need for broader research. In this exercise, differences between individuals can be observed in how exercise affects fly lines and sexes differently. In fact, because of the ease of using a variety of fly lines and many individuals, the experiment can very effectively demonstrate how exercise has more complicated and diverse physiological effects than what many people may believe. The focus of the experiment is closely related to real-world problems, such as sedentary lifestyles, obesity, and cardiovascular complications, which could encourage more students to become engaged in an alternative hands-on learning environment, as opposed to a typical didactic lecture-based classroom (36,37).

Additional work has revealed that active learning also decreases the achievement gap for first-generation and other underrepresented students (24). Overall, 41.6% of the full time students in the University of Maine System are first-generation students (https://staticweb.maine.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/First-Generation-Report-to-the-Legislature-2015.pdf?565a1d); therefore, it was important to our group that we use instructional techniques that support their learning.

We also used examples that are economically relevant to the state of Maine throughout the lesson, and observed that students became more engaged when the discussion included an organism important to their community. For example, when students with experience in the timber industry were shown predicted changes in tree species community structure that correlated with an increase in global temperature, they commented on the potential economic disadvantages to their area. Students living in the potato farming region of the state commented on the specifics of how fertilizers are used and the effects these chemicals have on their community over time. Finally, at a campus near the coast, students connected the lesson to research on sugar kelp that was being conducted in their department.

Although the examples in this lesson focused on Maine industries, we encourage instructors to modify the lesson to connect it to economically relevant photosynthetic organisms in their own area. We used organisms that are grown in a variety of ways with both terrestrial (potato and timber) and aquatic (sugar kelp) examples to provide a variety of contexts in which students could apply photosynthetic concepts. To extend this work into other regions, instructors can consult data about local crop production (e.g. https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/; https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/), guides focused on aquatic photosynthetic organisms (e.g. https://aquaplant.tamu.edu/plant-identification/; http://www.algaebase.org/), and information about farming in the ocean (e.g. https://ideas.ted.com/vertical-ocean-farms-that-can-feed-us-and-help-our-seas/; https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/08/22/542903378/scientists-hope-to-farm-the-biofuel-of-the-future-in-the-pacific-ocean; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2017.00100/full).

It teaches practical and essential scientific literacy skills by having students analyze data that a real company reports on its website about a real—and controversial—food supplement.

We designed the lesson to involve all students. Everyone completes the preparatory pre-class work. We project the TED talk (https://www.ted.com/talks/molly_crockett_beware_neuro_bunk) with closed captioning, and students can refer to the transcript of the talk while they complete the in-class activities. Everyone becomes an expert in the first half of the jigsaw, and everyone shares their expertise in the second half of the jigsaw. The jigsaw format, in particular, promotes inclusive teaching (21). 

The students learn through many different strategies, including individual writing and large and small group discussions. The number of strategies means that students who favor different approaches to learning will benefit from this lesson. Small groups can be formed through a variety of mechanisms that promote inclusion in ways that reflect each instructor’s overarching goals for a course (23).

However, based on personal observation, we prefer to allow students to self-select their groups because students pick other students with whom they feel comfortable working. In addition, self-selected groups tend to mimic real-world working groups more than randomly assigned groups because both self-selected groups and real-world working groups are usually composed of one or two people who know each other plus others who may not (16). Indeed, self-selection appears to add more value to the students' experience when considering communication, enthusiasm, pride, and attitude towards their work (16).

Courses implementing this laboratory lesson are designed for first- and second-year undergraduate students majoring in biology and/or allied health, as well as students majoring in non-science fields. Implementation of this laboratory lesson was primarily at Century College, a community college. Importantly, this laboratory lesson provides a research experience for community college and introductory level students, who ordinarily do not have the chance to participate in primary research. When designing the project, we were mindful of the inherent cultural and socioeconomic diversity, particularly of our community college student population.

Engaging community college students in research has been shown to benefit students in a variety of ways, including their transfer to four-year STEM programs, and several research programs targeting community college students are successfully implemented (31,32). Despite the focus on competency-based and experiential learning in higher education, it is still relatively uncommon for community college students to conduct primary, original research on the large scale that this lesson provides. According to data from the American Association of Community Colleges in 2012, an estimated 12.8 million students enrolled at a community college, accounting for 45% of all undergraduates in the United States. 56% of STEM undergraduate students attended a community college at some point of their studies (31). These large enrollment numbers underscore the increasing impact that community colleges are having on the undergraduate education of in the United States. Community college students vary greatly in age and other demographic variables such as income and ethnicity. According to the American Association of Community Colleges, the average age of the community college student population is 28 with approximately 36% enrolled as first-generation college students (33). Moreover, 36% of community college students receive Pell grants. In 2015, at Century College, approximately 55% of the students at the community college were first generation college students with little or no previous exposure to science courses (34).

While the lesson is inherently inclusive, there are also varieties of specific activities that will accommodate the needs of students with diverse learning styles. From development of the group hypotheses to analysis of results, the laboratory lesson is collaborative, ""easing the way"" to scientific experimentation for students. Students learn how to balance an 'ideal' experimental design with feasibility, specifically of obtaining soil samples from locations to which students have access. Discussion throughout the laboratory lesson emphasizes the prevalence and timely importance of spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment as it relates to the greater community.

Spatial skills have been correlated to success in STEM fields (3). Unfortunately, studies have also shown that there is a gender gap in performance on spatial skills assessments (4). Spatial skills competency can increase with practice (5). The activities presented here give all students a chance to practice their spatial skills by exploring 3-D structure at their own pace. It should also be noted that the molecular models of the proteins can be 3-D printed, which further benefits students who struggle with spatial perception and those students who are visually impaired.

First, by engaging students in think-pair-share and group discussion as well as by using volunteer-response questions, the Lesson accommodates both introverts and extroverts. Having both student-selected groups as well as groups formed randomly also lets all the students access the varying expertise of peers that they might not normally choose to interact with. Third, the topic of the Lesson itself, how mutation affects protein sequence, is inextricably coupled with appreciation for the basis of diversity: DNA sequence changes leading to protein sequence changes via the central dogma. The Lesson also promotes diversity by allowing students to select a gene sequence of their own choosing for analysis, rather than every student working on the same gene selected by the instructor. Such an approach allows the Lesson to show case genetic diversity and to allow the students to draw broad conclusions about similarities and differences resulting from related types of mutations. Finally, the example used in the first class to motivate the Lesson, the genetic basis of human earwax type, provokes questions about the genetic differences between human populations and potential forces promoting those differences.",192,,,,,

We go over this historical information before our field trip. Finally, students are contributing to an ever-growing longitudinal data set on serpentine plant communities useful to resource managers and researchers.

I address parity of student contributions to group activities each lab by interacting with each group and asking them how each member is contributing.

At the beginning of the lesson, students make a prediction about the likelihood of an uninfected T cell occurring in a population that contains equal numbers of HIV particles and T cells. Making a prediction increases students’ curiosity and intellectual investment in the activity (12,13). The core of the activity is creating a simulation by passing a mock petri dish around as they ‘infect’ plastic eggs. By default, friendly attention was drawn to the person holding the petri dish. The opening, inserting, closing, and mixing parts offer students a kinesthetic feel so that later they may associate this process with this distribution. Because every student participates, this inclusion helps shy students voice their opinions when it is their turn to contribute. We note that this activity used Easter eggs for convenience and economy. Instructors will need to be sensitive about the association of Easter eggs with a Christian holiday, and that a religious reference may exclude some students. Alternatives to Easter eggs include plastic food bags, sewing kits, ring boxes, or change purses.

This lesson allows students to engage in the material in a variety of ways: individual clicker questions, peer discussion, drawing, and writing. Clicker questions, which students answer individually for the first vote, allow all students, regardless of ability, to engage in thinking and applying their knowledge, and receiving feedback (as the clicker questions are always followed-up with feedback from the instructor). We do not grade the clicker questions for correctness but rather use them for instructor and student feedback, creating a feedback-rich, low-stakes learning opportunity. Students are allowed to self-select their peer groups or to work individually (although in our experience almost all students participated in the group work portion of the class). The combination of clicker questions, peer discussion, and in-class problem solving with handouts allows for the variety of student abilities and learning preferences to be satisfied, while maintaining a high level of engagement.

The lesson also emphasizes the collaborative and interdependent nature of science by utilizing an open resource that is compiled, reviewed, and annotated by scientists from around the world investigating many different questions and utilizing these resources in many different ways. The subject matter of this lesson, namely sex determination and definitions of sex (and gender, in Optional Extension 2) also provide opportunities for exploring differences that exist in how biologists and non-biologists may define or think about sex (i.e. definitions of maleness and femaleness). Further, discussion of sex-reversal and possible mismatches between genotypic sex and phenotypic sex provides an opportunity to extend students’ understanding of sex from a simple dichotomy to a diverse spectrum.",133,,,,,

Providing an opportunity for students to work in groups.  To help ensure students are participating and including others, the instructor and teaching assistants should walk around the classroom and ask questions to bring disengaged students into the group.
Asking the most difficult questions on the activity worksheet as clicker questions at the end of class.  Students who are confused about the worksheet questions and not getting the help they need from their peers are able to signal to the instructor that they do not understand by their votes on clicker questions.  After the clicker responses come in, the instructor can gauge class understanding, and immediately begin to address any confusion by initiating a whole-class discussion.
Focusing on types of cancer that are common in different racial/ethnic groups.  In this unit, students answer questions about prostate cancer; African American men have the highest incidence rate for prostate cancer in the United States (information found at the National Cancer Institute website, http://www.seer.cancer.gov/)

This pairing helped them work together to solve the more technical aspects of the experiment as outlined in the module (Supplemental File S1). We anticipated that some students would choose not to swab their own mouth and were prepared to provide them with a previously isolated DNA sample. Using this DNA sample, they could participate in the BLAST search and analysis. Had students chosen not to swab their oral cavity, they could make observations from a fellow classmate’s plates, provided they did not handle an opened plate themselves. This is in compliance with the biological safety policy at the University of MN. Students are allowed to handle cultured samples of their own body microflora because it is presumably part of their own normal flora. However, they must still wear personal protective equipment when handling cultured bacteria, including long pants, closed-toed shoes, disposable gloves, eye protection and a laboratory coat. We were pleased to note that all of our students participated and were able to identify a diversity of microbes in their mouths. In order for students to more fully appreciate this diversity, the de-identified results were pooled and shared between the two sections that participated in the pilot study. Students were able to observe the differences between the two sections and think about how this difference might impact human health and disease.",230,,,,,

Online Information Literacy: Applying the CRAAP Test to Vaccine (Mis)information,https://doi.org/10.24918/cs.2022.44,Lesson,2022,Science Process Skills,"Vaccines, immunity, reliability",Yes,"There are several ways that this lesson incorporates principles of inclusive teaching. In the individual portion of the activity, students select which online resources they work with. Incorporating student choice is part of a learner-centered approach that promotes student engagement (26). The lesson also includes different types of engagement by incorporating individual and group components. Students prepare for group work by completing individual work at their own pace, which promotes equitable participation during the group work (27). The group work features several cooperative learning characteristics meant to promote inclusive student-student dynamics, including the use of assigned group roles, a specific task for the group to complete, and a structured agenda with space for all students to present their ideas (24). Providing students with clear assessment criteria in the form of a rubric before they begin working on the assignment also improves the inclusivity of this lesson. Research shows that increasing transparency in college courses benefits all students, and in particular, underserved students (28).",163,,,,,

A video can be paused, slowed, zoomed in, or sped up depending on the learning personality of the student. Videos allow all students to see the technique from a close up angle that is not possible in a classroom setting. In fact, a video allows students to see more detail then they would in a classroom. Also, closed captions or a transcript can be added to videos to increase accessibility. Having former students serve as demonstrators in videos can support diversity and inclusion by using diverse demonstrators. Finally, videos allow for increased consistency across multiple-section courses.",111,,,,,

The central discussions revolve around why diversity is important at the intra-individual (Module 1), intraspecific (Modules 2 and 3), and interspecific (Modules 2 and 3) levels. Examples used in class should generalize the material to other problems and systems, specifically those related to human health because many science majors are interested in careers in health care. For example, the paired study design used in Module 1 should be related to clinical trials in which data are collected before and after a treatment is administered to a patient. Examples of allometry, the focus of Module 2, can refer to the hypo-allometric growth of the brain and the heart in humans (22). Finally, Module 3 requires students to bring their own leaves to the lab for analysis, thus providing students the opportunity to explore nature in their surrounding environments, such as their homes or neighborhoods.

Students work in groups of 2–4 students so that individuals with restricted motor skills or with vision impairment can delegate microscope and caliper work to students without these limitations. Formative assessments include low-stakes quizzes (to assess preparation for class) and worksheets that can be completed collaboratively during class period. Students are required to bring a laptop computer to laboratories. At Pace University, laptop computers can be borrowed from the campus library, which might also be an option at other institutions. When access to laptop computers is limited, students can work in groups of 2 to 4 students for data entry and analysis.
